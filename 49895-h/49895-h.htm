<h2>PREFACE</h2>

<p class="chapstart">This work was published by the late author in 1903, and a
second, and largely remodelled, edition appeared in 1907. For
some years past it has been out of print, to the loss of more
recent students. The delay, however, has not been without
its compensations, as librarianship has made several advances
which have been generally accepted, and has made many experiments,
the issue of which is not yet decided, in the twelve
years since the publication of the second edition. The work
has been regarded with much justice as the most comprehensive
complete treatise on library economy, and is the standard
to which most British libraries conform in general; indeed,
it is not too much to say that the whole modern school of
librarians here has been moulded by the work. When, therefore,
I was asked to prepare a new edition I was faced with the question
of how best to preserve its comprehensive character. I might
have revised it conservatively, merely touching up the statistics,
adding to the bibliographies, and correcting statements which
have been modified by later experience; but that would have
left the book partial and incomplete. Rightly or wrongly,
I have rewritten almost every chapter, have added sections on
questions touched upon only lightly or not at all in previous
editions, and have omitted several statements in which strong
personal views were expressed; in fact, I have tried to preserve
everything that seemed to be of permanent value, to excise
everything merely controversial, and to avoid obtruding any
idiosyncrasies of my own. I cannot hope to have succeeded
completely, and any suggestions for the improvement of future
editions will be welcomed.</p>

<p>Both of the earlier editions retain their value for
students,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
but the criticism which may fairly be levelled at them is that
Brown rarely contemplated the needs of a library of more
than 40,000 volumes, and, therefore, omitted much that is
necessary in the administration of such libraries. I have tried
to balance this. It is perhaps desirable to set out the particulars
in which the third edition differs from the second.
The following chapters have been rewritten in their entirety:
IV., V., VI., XV., XVIII., XX. and XXVII. The following
are new: all Divisions I., XIII. and XIV.; and Chapters
VII., XXVII., XXVIII., XXIX. and XXX. Everything else
has been retouched, except the chapter on museums and art
galleries; that I have left, because although the librarian
ought to have a knowledge of curatorship, that knowledge
is not library economy; and, within its limits, the chapter is
good common sense. I have dealt drastically with the bibliographies,
which consisted in the main of lists of articles in
library periodicals. Every library student knows that textbooks
and treatises are supplemented by periodical literature,
and a reference to the indexes of library journals should be an
obvious thing for him to make on any subject; and seeing
that we have Cannons&#8217;s <i>Bibliography of Library Economy</i>, 1876-1909,
for the years covered by the title, and that the best articles
are now indexed in the Library Association Index, it seemed
sufficient to make a general reference to Cannons and otherwise
restrict the lists with few exceptions to separate publications.
Appendix II, &#8220;The Librarian&#8217;s Library,&#8221; has been revised by
Mr Richard Wright, M.C., to whom my thanks are due. An
important omission is the Appendix of &#8220;Factors and Percentages,&#8221;
which gave figures for calculating the size, cost,
output, etc., of libraries. This has been deliberate; the conditions
created by the War are so fluid that factors which are
likely to have a permanent value are impossible to compile.
Brown&#8217;s <i>Guide to Librarianship</i> gives the pre-war factors, and it
is unnecessary to reprint them here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span></p>

<p>The Memoir is based upon the obituary notices and appreciations
which were collected and edited by Mr L. Stanley Jast
for <i>The Library Association Record</i>, the biographical facts in
particular being drawn from the memoir by Brown&#8217;s nephew,
Mr James Douglas Stewart, which is included in those notices.
Others will share my regret that his preoccupation with his
new work at Manchester prevented Mr Jast from revising this
<i>Manual</i>. I cannot but perceive, now that my work is finished,
how much better it would have been had he filled my place.
A few notes, prepared by Mr Jast for Chapters I.-II., have been
included.</p>

<p>Usually, when one has written a book, one has to acknowledge
much help from other librarians, but, owing to the
extraordinary circumstances in which this revision has been
made, I felt that I ought not to call for help from others
already overburdened. My own task has been completed
under great pressure, most of the work being done between
6.30 and 8.30 a.m. My wife has saved me from many
blunders, and her experience as a former member of Mr
Brown&#8217;s staff has been most valuable to me.</p>

<p class="chapstart fsize80"><span class="smcap">Postscript.</span>&mdash;As the final proofs are leaving my hands I learn
that the long-expected Government Bill to remove the penny rate
limitation was introduced into the House of Commons by Mr
Herbert Lewis and read a first time on the 28th of November.
The second reading occurred on the 2nd of December, and the
Bill became law on the 23rd of December 1919.</p>

<p class="fsize80">It is now practically certain that the powers in regard to Public
Libraries which were held by the Local Government Board now
accrue to the Ministry of Education, and, consequently, wherever
the Local Government Board is mentioned in the <i>Manual</i>, the
Ministry of Education should be understood.&mdash;W. C. B. S.</p>

<h2>DIVISION I<br />
INTRODUCTORY</h2>

<h3>MEMOIR</h3>

<p class="chapstart">On Christmas Day 1878 a Scottish lad of seventeen, having
realized a cherished desire and obtained an appointment as
junior library assistant at the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, presented
himself before the then unimposing portals of that
institution at the north corner of Ingram Street, and found
them closed. He concluded characteristically that this was
because the librarian was an Englishman. The lad who endeavoured
to begin what was his real life-work on this unusual
day was James Duff Brown, who was to become in many ways
the greatest practical influence of his time in the British public
library movement, who lived through its most expansive
period, codified and published its methods and results, experimented
boldly, faced and overcame a remarkable force of
opposition, and left behind him a memory which present
librarians revere, and works which will not easily be forgotten.</p>

<p>We have no record of his earliest years, other than that he was
born at Edinburgh on 6th November 1862, and during boyhood
showed tenacity and mental acquisitiveness. At thirteen he
became an apprentice in the publishing house of Edmonstone
&amp; Douglas in his native city, and in the same year, when Mr
Douglas left that firm at the establishment of that of Douglas
&amp; Foulis, he remained with Mr Douglas. A year later found
him at Glasgow with the firm of W. R. McPhun &amp; Sons. The
work done for these firms gave him an initiation of a kind into
literature, but the earlier Glasgow period was never a happy
memory of his, and his true career began at the Mitchell Library.
Here he spent ten years, enlarging his knowledge, specializing
thoroughly in librarianship, devoting much of his leisure to
musical lore, and by ability and purposefulness working his way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
to responsible positions on the library staff. When he was
twenty-one he began to collect material for his <i>Biographical
Dictionary of Musicians</i>, which appeared four years later in 1886;
at twenty-three was Glasgow correspondent to <i>The Musical
Standard</i>; and he was the editor and reviser of the six large
quarto volumes of Chalmers&#8217;s <i>Caledonia</i> which appeared 1887-90.
The industry thus shown was inherent in his character. He told
Mr T. A. Aldred that he acquired the early-rising habit in youth,
and that most of his work was done in the mornings before he
began his official day&#8217;s work at 9 a.m.; and the Mitchell was at
some distance from his home. This habit, which few of us ever
acquire, he retained through life. It is interesting to know that
he served from 1886 to about 1888 in the Third Lanark Volunteers;
a little booklet from his pen, <i>A Volunteer Reconnaissance</i>,
records his experiences.</p>

<p>A large library, however liberally administered, does not
often offer opportunities for a man&#8217;s larger initiative unless he
occupies one of the chief positions; and the exercise of his gifts
did not come fully until his appointment in 1888 to the newly-established
Clerkenwell Public Library in London. The building
is a comparatively small edifice occupying a triangular site, and
hardly one in which experiments little short of epoch-making
might be expected; but Brown was a man of ideas and courage
who could make the most of such a building. Moreover, London
offered him openings which he did not hesitate to take. Retiring
in person as a rule, nervous in speech, and in appearance of no
special significance, he yet threw himself with quiet energy into
the work of the Library Association. It must be remembered
that from about 1888 to 1898 the public library movement in
England received its greatest impetus, probably because in those
years the full effects of the Education Act of 1870 came into play.
Few of the libraries founded in that period are entirely without
marks of his influence. In 1891 he conceived the idea&mdash;very old
in itself, but quite new in its application to municipal libraries
in this country&mdash;of throwing open the shelves to the choice of
readers; and he formulated a scheme, which he called by the
somewhat tautological name of &#8220;safe-guarded open access,&#8221;
and published it anonymously in <i>The Library</i> in a paper entitled
&#8220;A Plea for Liberty to Readers to Help Themselves.&#8221; A visit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
to America in 1893, where he attended the Chicago Conference
of the American Library Association as a delegate of the Library
Association, confirmed him in his opinion of the practical
desirability of the system, although he says, &#8220;There was no such
thing as proper safe-guarded open access as now understood
anywhere in America when I was there&#8221;; but free access there
was, without the locking wickets and other safeguards which he
introduced at Clerkenwell. In brief, his method was to admit
readers to the shelves, but by way of a wicket at which their
credentials were checked unobtrusively, and to allow them to
pass out at another wicket at which the books chosen were
charged. Thus the reader was locked in the library while making
his choice. The results of his experiment were presented to the
Belfast Conference in a paper he wrote in collaboration with one
of his Committee, Mr Henry W. Fincham, entitled &#8220;The Clerkenwell
Open Lending Library,&#8221; which was modest and restrained
in tone; but although the discussion that ensued was generous
and appreciative to an extent, it was the fiercest yet known
amongst librarians, and the question became the most contested
one in our work. So sharp were the divisions the simple suggestion
created that the municipal library profession went into two
armed camps, and friendships and good-feeling were frequently
destroyed by it. It is difficult for younger librarians to realize
the courage and confidence that were needed to champion open
access twenty-five years ago against the active antagonism of
90 per cent. of the profession. There were not wanting men,
however, who were drawn to the champion, amongst them
Mr L. Stanley Jast, then librarian of Peterborough, Mr T.
Johnston, librarian of Croydon, and Mr Brown&#8217;s own assistants,
Mr Charles Riddle in particular, who opened the first library
outside London on this system at Bournemouth in 1895. In
1896 Croydon adopted it, Hornsey followed in 1898, and although
progress was slow at first, to-day it has so far won the battle that
the opening of a new library on any other system is a matter for
surprise, and many of the more conservative libraries, even in
the largest cities, have adopted it at least in some part of their
system; moreover, the question itself has become impersonal, and
no librarian to-day would criticize another for any views he might
hold in connexion with it. It was, as Sir J. Y. W. MacAlister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
declared in 1894, &#8220;the dawn of a new epoch; a hundred years
hence the authorities of the greater municipal London, which
will then be carrying on the work now only attempted by the
present congeries of village communities, will pass a resolution
ordering a tablet to be fixed to the wall of a quaint three-cornered
building in Clerkenwell, to commemorate the fact that here, in
1894, the revolution had begun which in a few years had
changed the entire system of public libraries throughout the
land.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although safe-guarded open access was the principal practical
contribution of Brown to library practice, he introduced other
things of great importance. His <i>Quarterly Guide</i> was the first
annotated library bulletin published in England. He invented
an indicator, more compact and perhaps as effective as most
others, as a challenge to another similar inventor. He improved
the sheaf catalogue, and indeed many of the commonest appliances
now in use were of his contriving. A description of these,
and others, he gave in his <i>Handbook of Library Appliances</i>, 1892,
published by the Library Association. As open access abolished
the need for alphabetical indicator-keys, he was at liberty to
consider the question of catalogues radically; and he advocated
the classified catalogue and class-lists as fulfilling the needs of
students and readers better than other forms. In this advocacy
he secured the vigorous co-operation of Mr Jast; and in this
matter also a great controversy ran for some years, dignified
amongst librarians as &#8220;the battle of the catalogues.&#8221; The issue
is still in doubt as to the entire desirability of the classified
catalogue for all purposes and places, but to-day the classified
catalogue is certainly as common as any other form.</p>

<p>His brain and pen were active throughout life. In 1897 he
published, in conjunction with Stephen Stratton, a <i>British Musical
Biography</i>, another valuable biographical dictionary. In 1898
he founded, and for many years was to edit, <i>The Library World</i>,
an independent and radical journal of library methodology and
politics, which has held its own to this day. Opinions of all
kinds were expressed in its pages; Brown wrote innumerable
articles for it; and many librarians of present distinction first
saw themselves in print in its pages. Especially did Brown
encourage through its pages the struggles of young and unknown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
men at a time when encouragement was of priceless value to
them. A list of his works is given at the end of this chapter, and
will be sufficient to show his energy; but the appearance of his
<i>Manual of Library Classification and Shelf Arrangement</i>, 1898,
which contained his Adjustable Classification, was a real event,
because it was the first comprehensive treatment of a till then
little understood and much abused subject; as was that of his
greatest work, the <i>Manual of Library Economy</i>, which first
appeared in 1903, and has influenced all library methodology.</p>

<p>Quiet as he was in many ways, he was of a social disposition,
a trait which found an outlet to some extent at the Library
Association, of which he was a councillor from 1890 to 1911;
but for closer purposes of <i>camaraderie</i> he founded, with Mr Jast,
the well-known Pseudonyms, a dining-club of librarians and
their friends, which had its origin in the &#8216;nineties, and flourished
for many years. The meetings were held in various Bohemian
restaurants in Soho, professional and literary topics were debated,
and Brown reported them in <i>The Library World</i>. The reports
had little relation to the actual proceedings, and few people
were more entertained, and, incidentally, astonished at their
own wittiness (as reported) than the Pseudonyms themselves.
This is but one instance of his humorous way of regarding
all things. In conversation, and in writing of even the most
dryasdust subjects, it seemed impossible for him to talk or
write without humour.</p>

<p>Brown&#8217;s sixteen years at Clerkenwell made the library perhaps
the most reputed in the country. Mr Jast may be quoted upon
this: &#8220;Mr Brown&#8217;s influence and reputation extended far beyond
his own country. Foreign librarians visiting London almost
invariably made for two places; one was the large and handsome
room overlooking a stately west-end square, which Mr J. Y. W.
MacAlister occupied for so many years; and the other was a
small room, high up in a rather dingy-looking triangular building,
overlooking a dingier street in Clerkenwell, which was so hidden
away that one rather stumbled upon it than found it, where
Mr J. D. Brown worked in his official capacity as Librarian, before
he was called to a sphere more worthy of his labours, in Islington.
How many librarians, how many members of library committees,
how many workers in the Library movement have been charmed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
interested, and instructed in these two rooms?&#8221; Not only was he
required to give advice in his own country; at different times he
was called upon to lecture on &#8220;free public libraries&#8221; in the
United States, in Holland and in Belgium. &#8220;A Bruxelles,&#8221;
writes M. Paul Otlet, &#8220;il parla devant l&#8217;auditore du Mus&eacute;e du
Livre et son succ&egrave;s fut tr&egrave;s grand.&#8221; I cannot help thinking
that his success depended more upon his subject and his clear
writing than upon his speaking; he was on the whole an indifferent
speaker, his nervousness was painful to himself and
others, and his ineradicable Glasgow accent was a real obstacle.
He told my wife that the only place in which he enjoyed speaking
was the meetings of the Islington Staff Club; he confessed to a
horror and nervousness in public speech.</p>

<p>In 1904 he was appointed the first Borough Librarian of
Islington. Here the public libraries scheme had its very beginnings
under his care, and he was responsible for the interior
design of the fine central library and the north and west
branches; probably also for the south-east branch, but of that
I am not sure. These libraries, I dare affirm, represented the
highest achievement in library-planning in this country, with
their handsome, adequate and practical rooms, economy in working,
and general suitableness for their purpose. Here he brought
into practice two of his principal innovations. The first was the
Subject Classification, a huge, minute scheme, which we describe
in more detail in the later pages of this book, which challenged
comparison with the great and more popular American schemes
in its completeness, logical arrangement, and admirable notation.
Its focus upon British requirements made it specially attractive
to British librarians, and although it may never supersede the
more universal Decimal System of Melvil Dewey, it is nevertheless
a work of the greatest value to all librarians. The second
and more revolutionary innovation was the exclusion of the
newsroom as usually understood from the libraries. In his
account of his visit to America, he mentioned with something
approaching disapproval the absence of this department from
American libraries and the sense of desertion which resulted
there; but at Islington he adopted the American plan. I am
told that the Islington public did not approve the omission quite
as much as did its author, but the arguments he used for it were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
common-sense ones, although he has had few, if any, British
imitators.</p>

<p>To give in detail all his work for Islington would be to occupy
a disproportionate space in a memoir of this compass. Suffice it
to say that he provided this not entirely grateful Borough with
a system which is the admiration of our profession. He gathered
round him an accomplished staff, published a model select
catalogue, encouraged the formation of an excellent staff guild
for his assistants, and did many other invaluable things. He
had long been a teacher of young librarians. When the Library
Association courses were inaugurated at the London School of
Economics he became the lecturer in library organization and
routine, and served in that capacity for many years. As one of
his students, I can vouch for his conscientious, painstaking
teaching, his care in clearing up difficulties, the encouraging and
friendly way in which he answered our questions, marked our
exercises, and generally made our work of interest and value.
No librarian who turned to him for advice ever went unhelped,
whatever his age or school of thought. He wrote hundreds of
letters to such purpose in his beautiful minute handwriting, and
a collection of these would form, I believe, an excellent journal
of contemporary librarianship. He seemed, in particular, to
have a minute knowledge of all librarians and library assistants,
their capacities and work accomplished. His obvious sympathy
with young assistants first drew many of us to him. From the
day I met him in 1896 at Bournemouth to his death he showed
me by constant signs his regard for younger men and women
who had a real interest in the work that he himself loved. He
treated us with equal consideration in his correspondence, and
the youngest correspondent received the same courtesy as his
elders. He drafted the constitution of the Library Assistants&#8217;
Association, which with slight modifications has proved most
wise and successful; and he frequently, especially in his last
years, attended the meetings of this Association, taking part in
the discussions when invited to do so, but seldom intruding his
opinions unasked upon his young listeners, who, be it remarked,
were always eager to hear him.</p>

<p>It is a difficult task to sketch &#8220;the man in his habit as he lived,&#8221;
but a few words may be written. The portrait which forms our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
frontispiece is almost life-like, with its thoughtful, quiet, and,
if one looks carefully enough, intent and humorous face. In
person he was small, but not too obviously so; fragile-looking,
but yet compact and vital in appearance and movement; he had
brown hair and beard, delicate features, deft and supple hands;
he thought calmly, was a rapid, consistent, and persevering
worker; what he began he finished. His writings have been
pronounced by Dr E. A. Baker to possess unmistakable quality,
although &#8220;he scoffed at the word &#8216;style&#8217; as denoting some
futile kind of verbal legerdemain&#8221; (I think he must have done so
jokingly, as his own personal library showed that he was by no
means blind to the qualities of literary expression). &#8220;Shrewd,
practical common sense, rough on cranks and sentimentalists,
unmerciful to muddlers, impervious to a good many ideas, but
a steady assertor of those he had tried and approved&mdash;this was
the stuff of Brown&#8217;s writing,&#8221; is Dr Baker&#8217;s estimate, and in the
main it coincides with my own. His personal tastes may be
inferred from his work. &#8220;He once told me,&#8221; writes Mr Aldred,
&#8220;he knew three subjects only, viz., library economy, music, and
Scotland. I forget the order in which he placed them. Being
a Scotsman, probably Scotland came first. In many respects,
however, J. D. B.&#8217;s knowledge was of the encyclop&aelig;dic order&mdash;he
appeared to know a little of any subject named.&#8221;</p>

<p>In early life he was pronounced to be consumptive, but he told
me, &#8220;I have lived to see the doctors who condemned me in their
graves,&#8221; by careful living, and probably by sheer will power.
But in his later years he had to meet many difficulties at Islington,
where the libraries became the sport of a political party and
he had a committee which was unable to assess his powers. It
is useless to revive this now, but it probably helped to bring
about his early death. He first became seriously ill in 1911,
and with a few intervals, when we believed him to be practically
himself again, he gradually weakened. In the last few months
of his life a stay at Bournemouth was tried as a final resource,
and here he read musical biography assiduously and maintained
the keenest outlook upon all things; but no improvement
ensued in his health, and he returned to London a dying man.
The end came at his house, 15, Canonbury Park South, Islington,
on 26th February 1914; and he was buried, amid every sign of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
regret and affection, at New Southgate Cemetery. His only
memorial to the present are his works; I believe they will be an
enduring one.</p>

<p>To sum up: Brown entered upon his library career at a time
when the library movement received its greatest impetus, and
brought the whole force of a fertile and inventive mind and a
ready pen into its service. He wrote the first text-books actually
intended for English public librarians, collected and systematized
all available methodology, and, thoroughly believing in his
mission, this man more than any other in his generation fashioned
in this country a living, interesting profession out of the despised
materials of the popular library. An impression written by
Alderman H. Keatley Moore, B.A., B.Mus., J.P., a veteran
worker for public libraries, who made his acquaintance early,
may serve to conclude this necessarily brief account of our
author:</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it especially that made one feel so clearly that one
was in the presence of a true man, of an absolute master of his
subject, of one, in fact, whom it was an honour to know?</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it was that curious quietness, the repose of a man
who has thought out everything fully for himself, and is content
to leave the facts as he has arranged them to tell their own story.
He was still, because he was so strong; he was undisturbed by
clamour because he had been through it all, and now stood in
the open with the conquered fortress behind him, its strength
his strength made visible; one gradually grew rather timid of
this shy talker because he always had the facts on his side....
He was the most unaffected and modest man of real mark that
I have ever met in my long public life. I shall always be glad
to have known him. I shall always remember the great services
he rendered to me, to my town, to our country. Across my
sincere regret at his loss flickers the whimsical thought of how
he would wonder at the fuss we are making over him.&#8221;</p>

<h3>INTRODUCTION<br />
<span class="title">LIBRARIANSHIP IN GREAT BRITAIN. THE PRESENT SCOPE OF THE
LIBRARY PROFESSION. METHODS OF THIS BOOK</span></h3>

<p class="chapstart">I. Library economy is a term covering every branch of work
concerned with libraries; and libraries may be defined in a
phrase as institutions devoted to the collecting, conserving and
exploiting of literature. Originally the prevalent character of
libraries was that of conserving rather than exploiting institutions,
and much of the technical equipment of the modern
librarian has come into being as a result of their progress from
their original &#8220;museum&#8221; to their present &#8220;workshop&#8221; character.
Our subject, then, covers the founding, organizing,
administration and routine of libraries. It is one of much wider
compass than is commonly supposed. Whatever may have been
the original intention, for example, of the pioneers of the municipal
public library movement, and there are still many who
seem to regard that movement as a counter-attraction to the
seductions of the saloon bar and similar places of recreation, the
present public library is a many-sided, active civic institution,
making its appeal to all classes of the community as a centre of
education, culture and recreation, with a trained service to direct
it. Nearly every other type of library also is most concerned
with the best means of attracting people to make use of literature,
and is an active force in the community rather than a passive one.</p>

<p id="Ref31">II. Libraries have been recognized as important in all ages,
and a brief study of the early civilizations of the East and of the
Mediterranean countries, as well as all later periods, shows the
existence of state, public, ecclesiastical and monastic libraries
for which there was some sort of librarianship, with even such
seemingly modern appliances as classification and cataloguing
of a kind. But the library as we know it to-day, and librarianship
in particular, may almost be said to be the creation of the
last half of the nineteenth century. Earlier town libraries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
indeed existed, the first, it is believed, being that at Norwich,
which was opened to the public in 1608; but although there were
individual instances, the municipal public library (commonly but
erroneously called the &#8220;free library,&#8221; because no charge is made
for its use) was a result of the Libraries Act of 1850 promoted by
William Ewart, M.P., who had at his back the real pioneer of
public libraries, Edward Edwards, whose <i>Memoir of Libraries</i>
is the most monumental of treatises on library history and
administration. The Act of 1850 had in view the needs of the
poor, sanctioned the levying of a halfpenny rate, and, with
curious want of vision, left the provision of books to the generosity
of private donors. The debates upon the bill before it became
law are curious and entertaining reading; and it appears that
the special purpose of libraries was the prevention of crime!
Progress was slow at first, but in 1853 it was stated that
thirteen towns had adopted the Act. In 1855 its provisions
were extended to Ireland, and in this amending bill the amount
that might be levied for libraries throughout the kingdom was
increased to a limit of one penny in the pound.</p>

<p id="Ref25">III. We need not follow the history of the movement, as an
excellent monograph by J. J. Ogle, <i>The Free Library</i>, is available
on the question; nor need we go into the parallel and in
some respects more wonderful development of the movement
in America. So far as this country is concerned libraries have
grown up in every considerable town, with very few exceptions;
but the whole movement has been retarded, even crippled, by
the retention of the limit of one penny in the pound as the amount
a local authority may spend on library provision. The advance
in general education&mdash;it must be remembered that in 1850 not
more than one-seventeenth of the children of the people were
receiving an education which could be called satisfactory even
when judged by the low standards of that time&mdash;has created a
new reading public more vast than was contemplated by the
promoters of the Act; but the only legal help towards meeting
its demands has come from the increased product of rate assessments;
the limit remains sixty-five years after its imposition.
But the increase we have mentioned has not been negligible,
even if it is entirely insufficient, and it has been assisted in a
remarkable way by private generosity. Amongst many who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
have provided towns with public library buildings, Passmore
Edwards, Lord Brassey, Henry Tate, Colonel Gamble and Professor
Sandeman may be mentioned; but the greatest impetus
to the movement was given by the systematic and almost universal
munificence of Andrew Carnegie, which began in 1886
and has been continued by him and by the Carnegie United
Kingdom Trust, which he has endowed, to the present. His
system has been to provide a suitable building on the condition
that the authority accepting it adopted the Libraries Act and
provided a site from other charges than the library rate. By
this means scores of towns which were without or had only
inferior library buildings now possess one in some way worthy
of the name.</p>

<p id="Ref35">IV. The expansion of libraries gave rise to the modern profession
of librarianship. The older libraries were usually in
the charge of scholars, whose main work was that of &#8220;keeper&#8221;
of the books, a title which the librarian in charge of the British
Museum still bears, although it does not now comprehend his
work. The municipal library required a man who was not
primarily a scholar, although scholarship was an invaluable
basis for his work; he was rather required to be an administrator,
a purveyor of books, and, because of the very limited moneys
at his disposal, something of a business man. For some years,
however, there was no definite science or art of librarianship in
this sense. Edward Edwards, in the second volume of his
<i>Memoirs of Libraries</i>, laid firmly the foundations of present
library economy in a r&eacute;sum&eacute; and exposition of the multifarious
methods of cataloguing, classification, library planning and
administration used in the various libraries of the world. Little
followed in England until the growing needs of the work caused
a few far-seeing librarians to find some means of bringing
librarians together. This they succeeded in doing in the successive
conferences of librarians, British and international, the
first of which was held in London in 1877. Out of these sprang
the Library Association in 1878, with Mr Henry R. Tedder and
the late E. B. Nicholson as its first honorary secretaries, and the
late Robert Harrison as honorary treasurer. In the first year the
late E. C. Thomas succeeded Nicholson, and somewhat later he
was associated in his office with Mr (now Sir) J. Y. W. MacAlister,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
one of the most significant and creative personalities in our work;
while Mr Tedder assumed the office of treasurer, which he holds
to this day, an office in which his wisdom and counsel as well as
his unsparing industry have done much to create the present
stability of the Association. By means of frequent gatherings,
especially by its annual meetings, the Library Association
gradually brought together the whole body of librarians in this
country, who read and discussed professional papers, published
proceedings, initiated scheme after scheme for the promotion
and improvement of libraries, and generally became the controlling
factor in library polity. It was incorporated by Royal
Charter in 1898. For many years it was recognized that training
in technical methods was necessary for librarians, and the
Association has devoted much attention to this work. At first
it held summer schools and, from 1898, other brief courses for
library students, and examined the students upon them. Later
it established, in connexion with the Governors of the London
School of Economics, regular courses of lectures at that institution.
A carefully-designed and remarkably helpful syllabus of
instruction was drawn up, and on this examinations were held
and certificates leading up to a diploma in librarianship were
issued. The latest phase of the educational work of the Association
has been the securing of a grant from the Carnegie United
Kingdom Trust for the establishment of a School of Librarianship
at University College, London, which it is expected will
commence on 1st October 1919. This will primarily be a day
school with courses of study founded on the syllabus of the
Association, which has been carefully revised and extended to
meet the new circumstances. It is ridiculous to prophesy, but
if this School is a success it is probable that it will revolutionize
the whole character of library service in this country.</p>

<p id="Ref26">V. There have been various definitions of the purpose of
libraries and librarians, few of them entirely adequate. We
shall not attempt another dogmatically, but we may suggest that
that purpose is to provide a representative and systematically
arranged collection of literature from the daily newspaper to the
elaborate treatise and encyclop&aelig;dic work of reference. The
methods of doing this, and of exploiting in the public interest the
collection when made, are the subject-matter of this manual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Until this primary purpose of a library is fulfilled any attempts
at those added activities which are advocated by some librarians
to-day are likely to be mistaken, or at least ill-advised. The
Library Association has not issued a comprehensive manifesto
covering this matter, and might very well do so, if care were
taken, as no doubt it would be, to give considerable elasticity
to the definitions. At the Annual Meeting in 1917, however,
it did adopt a series of resolutions of great importance, which,
as the almost unanimous pronouncement of the profession, must
find a place here. In the light of the rough definition given, their
inadequacy as a comprehensive statement of library work is
obvious enough, but they have great value as showing the trend
of that work in the effort to meet the remarkable intellectual,
industrial and other conditions created by the European War;
and this seems to us a justification for treating each of the
resolutions at greater length in the following pages:</p>

<p>1. &#8220;That the aim of the library as an educational institution
is best expressed in the formula &#8216;Self-development in an atmosphere
of freedom,&#8217; as contrasted with the aim of the school,
which is &#8216;Training in an atmosphere of restraint or discipline&#8217;;
in the school the teacher is dominant, because it is possible to pass
on a form, to teach an art; but in the library the pupil strikes
out his own line, and becomes his own teacher; the library
supplies the material upon which the powers awakened and
trained in the school can be exercised; the library and the school
depend upon different ideas, deal with different material in
different ways, and there is no administrative relation between
the two; furthermore, the contacts of the library with organized
education necessarily cease at the point where the educational
machinery itself terminates, but the library continues as an
educational force of national importance in its contacts with the
whole social, political and intellectual life of the community;
that the recognition of the true place of the library in education
must carry with it the provision of adequate financial resources,
which is impossible under the present limitation on the library
rate; such limitation therefore should be removed at the earliest
possible moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>2. &#8220;That the creation in the child of intellectual interests,
which is furthered by a love of books, is an urgent national need;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
that while it is the business of the school to foster the desire to
know, it is the business of the library to give adequate opportunity
for the satisfaction of this desire; that library work with
children ought to be the basis of all other library work; that
reading-rooms should be provided in all public libraries, where
children may read books in attractive surroundings, under the
sympathetic and tactful guidance of trained children&#8217;s librarians;
but that such provision will be largely futile except under the
conditions which experience, especially in America where the
importance of this work has long been recognized and where it
is highly developed, has shown to be essential to success.&#8221;</p>

<p id="Ref27">3. &#8220;That in view of meeting trade conditions after the war,
commercial libraries should be established in all the great trade
centres of the kingdom, as a part of the municipal library system,
where business men may obtain reliable commercial information,
by means of the collection and arrangement for rapid consultation
of all Government and other publications relating to commerce;
that such libraries should act as outliers or branches of
the Commercial Intelligence Department of the Board of Trade;
and that such Department should further the work of these
libraries in every possible way; that in the smaller towns commercial
collections should be formed.&#8221;</p>

<p id="Ref44">4. &#8220;That technical libraries are as essential, both to technical
education and to manufacture, as the laboratory or the workshop;
that discovery and invention are stimulated by books;
that the technical library, therefore, should be established as a
special department of the public library in all important manufacturing
towns, with a special organization, including a librarian
trained not only in library method and in the bibliography of
technology, but possessing also a sufficient technical knowledge
to enable him to act as a source of information to inquirers.&#8221;</p>

<p id="Ref38">5. &#8220;That collections of books and other printed and manuscript
matter bearing upon questions of local government should
be established in connexion with municipalities; that such collections
to be effective must be in charge of a trained librarian;
that the management of such collections should be placed under
the library committee; that the cost of such libraries will be
small in proportion to the valuable part they will play in serving
the needs, not only of officials entrusted with the carrying out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
of public work, but also of members of the municipality responsible
for local government finance and policy.&#8221;</p>

<p id="Ref30">VI. Since the succeeding chapters of this manual were revised
the Ministry of Reconstruction has issued a report on libraries
and museums which has been made by its Adult Education
Committee. This traverses in a general way the ground covered
by the Library Association resolutions and makes recommendations
of much moment and gravity. The aim of the report is
to explain the extent of libraries and to secure their co-ordination.
It criticizes Resolution 1 on the ground that it represents
the aims of education inadequately, and it deduces from several
very cogent arguments the policy of placing libraries under the
local education committees in order that they may be merged
into and worked as an extension of the national education
system. For London this would mean taking libraries from the
boroughs and placing them in the care of the county. The
matter is too unsettled to admit of argument here, but such a
policy, if carried out, might alter radically the whole character
of library provision and administration. The linking up of
libraries is recommended by means of a central lending library
in London, the municipal libraries, special libraries, and rural
libraries; the central lending library would supply the more
expensive, little-used books to students direct or through the
municipal or rural libraries, and special libraries should be drawn
upon in their specialities for books to be used throughout the
country. To the end that the service should be developed to
the greatest extent, the present income of libraries should be
increased, either by an increase in the separate library rate or
by abolishing that rate altogether and allowing the estimates of
the library to be included in general education estimates.</p>

<p>It seems quite probable that the near future will see a removal
of the main financial difficulties.</p>

<p>VII. This manual is based upon the syllabus of the Library
Association, but excludes sections 1 and, in part, 2 (Literary
History and Bibliography), and includes the subject-matter of
the resolutions of 1917. Primarily it is a manual of municipal
library practice, but is by no means exclusively so. Special
libraries have their individual methods, and a general conspectus
of librarianship cannot include them; and state, university,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
institutional, club and private libraries are equally matters for
specific treatment such as would be impossible here. But all
libraries are faced with very similar problems of selection,
accession, classification, cataloguing, etc., or at any rate they
differ in these matters in degree rather than in kind; and it is
hoped that for them much that follows will be at least interesting
and suggestive. To this end the method aimed at is expository
rather than argumentative; and when two or more methods
are in vogue they have been placed side by side in order that the
student may review them and form his own judgment of their
relative merits. Where we are dogmatic we are so unconsciously,
and we hope that aberrations of this kind will be passed
over with forbearance.</p>

<p class="bibliogr">1901. &#8220;1 Edw. 7. An Act to amend the Acts relating to Public Libraries,
Museums and Gymnasiums, and to regulate the liability of managers
of libraries to proceedings for libel.&#8221;</p>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This Act does <i>not</i> deal with actions for libel. It was originally
intended to do so, but the clauses were struck out of the bill, and the
title escaped emendation.]</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec2">2.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>2.</b> The whole of these are in force, and they repeal all the
former Acts dating from 1850, while incorporating some of their
provisions. In addition to these general Acts, a considerable
number of local Acts have been passed on behalf of various
towns, which include provisions for the modification of the
general Acts, chiefly in regard to removing the limitation of
the rate, and for other purposes. Such powers are usually
contained in improvement or tramway Acts, and the principal
towns which have obtained them include Manchester, Birmingham,
Glasgow, Edinburgh, Halifax, Darwen, Sheffield, Cardiff,
etc. Several towns, like Brighton, Huddersfield, Kingston-on-Thames,
have also special Acts which confer the power of
establishing libraries, independently of the general Acts, so
that the public libraries of Britain are not constituted under one
general law.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec3">3.</h4>

<p><b>3.</b> The Public Library Law is further modified or extended by
various other statutes which were passed for different purposes,
and the principal Acts of this kind are as follows:</p>

<p class="hind0_2 blankbefore">&#8220;24 &amp; 25 Vict., c. 97. An Act to consolidate and amend the
Statute Law of England and Ireland relating to malicious
injuries to property,&#8221; 1861.</p>

<p class="fsize80">This gives power to prosecute for misdemeanour any person who
unlawfully and maliciously destroys or damages any book, manuscript, etc.,
in any public museum, gallery, cabinet or library.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 blankbefore">&#8220;56 &amp; 57 Vict., c. 73. An Act to make further provision for
local government in England and Wales,&#8221; 1894.</p>

<p class="fsize80">Enables rural parishes to adopt the Public Libraries Act, 1892, by
means of a parish meeting or poll of the voters in the parish.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 blankbefore">&#8220;62 &amp; 63 Vict., c. 14. An Act to make better provision for
local government in London,&#8221; 1899.</p>

<p class="fsize80">Confers the power of adopting the Public Libraries Act, 1892, on the
Metropolitan Borough Councils, by extending to them the provisions of
the Public Libraries Act, 1893.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent blankbefore">The remaining statutes which in any way deal with public or
private libraries will be noticed in connexion with the departments
of library administration, to which they specially refer,
such as loans, rating, etc.</p>

<p>The only other Acts of Parliament which may in the future
influence public libraries are the Education Acts passed since
1902. Under these Acts local Education Boards are empowered
to &#8220;promote the general co-ordination of all forms of education,&#8221;
and in many districts the education and library authorities are
amalgamated for common purposes. It remains to be seen what
further extensions will take place.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec4">4. Main Provisions of the Municipal Libraries Acts.</h4>

<p><b>4. Main Provisions of the Municipal Libraries Acts.</b>&mdash;A brief
summary of the leading practical points of the various Acts will
serve to give an idea of the powers which are conferred upon
municipal authorities in regard to libraries:</p>

<p class="fsize80 blankbefore" id="Ref21">(<i>a</i>) <span class="smcap">Adoption
of Acts in Towns.</span>&mdash;The Acts may be adopted in any
city, county borough, burgh or urban district by a resolution passed by
the council, at a special meeting of which a month&#8217;s notice shall have
been given, and the resolution must be advertised publicly in the usual
way, and a copy sent to the Local Government Board, if the adoption is
in England or Ireland; while a notice of the fact of adoption must also
be sent.</p>

<p class="fsize80" id="Ref22">(<i>b</i>) <span class="smcap">Adoption of Acts in Parishes.</span>&mdash;In parishes in England and
Scotland the Acts can only be adopted by a majority vote of the householders
or voters.</p>

<p class="fsize80" id="Ref39">(<i>c</i>) <span class="smcap">Library Rate.</span>&mdash;A rate of one penny in the &pound; on the rateable
value of an administrative area is the limit fixed by the Act, but power is
given parishes to fix a smaller sum by a popular vote, and urban districts
of all kinds to remove or fix any rate within the limit of one penny by
resolution of the council.</p>

<p class="fsize80" id="Ref24">(<i>d</i>) <span class="smcap">Powers.</span>&mdash;The Library Authority may provide public libraries,
museums, schools for science, art galleries and schools for art, and for
that purpose may purchase and hire land, and erect, take down, rebuild,
alter, repair and extend buildings, and fit up, furnish and supply the
same with all requisite furniture, fittings and conveniences. The Library
Authority shall exercise the general management, regulation and control
of every department established under the provisions of the Acts, and may
provide books, newspapers, maps and specimens of art and science, and
cause the same to be bound and repaired when necessary. Also appoint
salaried officers and servants, and dismiss them, and make regulations for
the safety and use of every library, museum, gallery and school under its
control, and for admission of the public thereto. Power is also given
to make agreements with other library authorities for the joint use of
library or other buildings; and to borrow money, with the sanction
of<span class="pagenumlg"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the central authorities, for the purpose of buying sites, erecting buildings
and furnishing them. The Irish Act of 1877 also gives power to establish
schools of music as part of a library scheme.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec5">5. Non-Municipal Libraries: Acts of Parliament.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>5. Non-Municipal Libraries: Acts of Parliament.</b>&mdash;The legislation
affecting the large number of British libraries which are not
supported out of the rates is neither extensive nor satisfactory.
The chief feature of most of the Acts of Parliament which have
been passed seems to be the benevolent one of granting certain
facilities to various kinds of landowners to divest themselves of
their property in order to provide sites for literary and scientific
institutions. There are similar clauses in the Public Libraries
Acts, and, of course, most of the Acts named apply to municipal
libraries; but in reality this kind of legislation is not particularly
valuable. To make the transfer of land for public purposes more
easy is quite laudable, but it has not yet had the effect of inducing
landowners to part with free plots of land as building sites, either
to public library authorities or literary institutions.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec6">6.</h4>

<p><b>6.</b> The principal Act bearing on literary and scientific institutions
is entitled &#8220;An Act to afford greater facilities for the
establishment of Institutions for the promotion of Literature
and Science and the Fine Arts, and to provide for their better
regulation,&#8221; 17 &amp; 18 Vict., c. 112, 1854. This is nearly all taken
up with provisions for transfers of lands and other property, and
with a few regulations concerning members, rules, altering,
extending or dissolving the institution, etc. This Act was
afterwards to some extent modified by &#8220;An Act to facilitate
the transfer of Schools for Science and Art to Local Authorities,&#8221;
54 &amp; 55 Vict., c. 61, 1891. These, and the other Acts
referred to, which deal with transfers of property, have had
very little to do with the development of voluntary literary and
scientific institutions or libraries; the principal statute under
which most of them are now governed being an Act passed
primarily for quite a different purpose. This is the &#8220;Act to
amend the &#8216;Companies Act, 1862,&#8217;&#8221; 30 &amp; 31 Vict., c. 131, 1867,
under Section 23 of which power is given the Board of Trade to
grant licences to literary and similar associations, providing for
registration with limited liability, and conferring all the privileges
attaching to limited companies. In connexion with this Act,
and those of 1862 and 1877, the Board of Trade have issued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
a series of circulars and forms, which include draft rules,
articles of association, etc. Under these licences a considerable
number of British literary institutions have been established
and organized.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec7">7. British Colonial Library Legislation</h4>

<p><b>7. British Colonial Library Legislation</b> has proceeded very
much on the lines adopted in the mother country, and in every
case the permissive character of the Acts has been preserved,
and, in most cases, the rate limitation. On the other hand,
some effort has been made to keep in touch with schools and
universities.</p>

<p>In <b>South Africa</b> a Government proclamation established the
South African Public Library at Cape Town in 1818. This was
further regulated by an ordinance passed in 1836, which gave
the library the right to receive a free copy of every publication
issued in <span class="smcap">Cape Colony</span>. Other libraries in the large towns now
receive grants from the Government, and a large number of
smaller libraries also receive grants equal to the annual average
amount raised by subscriptions and donations during the three
preceding years; but in no case shall the amount of the Parliamentary
grant exceed &pound;150 for any one library in one year.
No grants are made if less than &pound;25 is raised by subscription.
In return for the grant, reading-rooms and reference libraries
are to be open free to the public, and an annual report has to be
presented to the Government. In <span class="smcap">Natal</span> the same arrangement
is made, though on a much smaller scale. In both colonies
books are only lent for home reading to subscribers. In 1874
an Act was passed by the Legislature of Natal for regulating
literary and other societies not legally incorporated.</p>

<p>In <b>Canada</b>, under a General Libraries Act of 1854, County
Councils were authorized to establish four classes of libraries:
(1) Ordinary common school libraries in each school-house for
the use of children and ratepayers; (2) a general public library
available to all ratepayers in the municipality; (3) professional
libraries of books on teaching, etc., for teachers only; and (4) a
library in any public institution under the control of a municipality.
Arrangements were made whereby the Education Office
sold books at low rates to the school libraries; and afterwards
the Education Department of the Legislature gave annual grants,
equal to the amounts contributed by members for book purchase,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to mechanics&#8217; institutes, etc., and subsequently increased
such grants for books to $400 (&pound;80) annually. The province of
Ontario, in 1882, passed &#8220;An Act to provide for the Establishment
of Free Libraries,&#8221; on lines very similar to the English Acts.
Power is given any city, town or incorporated village to provide
libraries, newsrooms, museums and branches, on the petition
and with the consent of the qualified electors. The management
is vested in a board chosen from the Town Council, citizens other
than councillors, and the Public School Boards. The library rate
is limited to an &#8220;annual rate not exceeding one half of a mill
in the dollar upon the assessed value of all rateable, real and
personal property.&#8221; This form of limitation is borrowed from
the practice of the United States. About ninety places have
adopted this Free Libraries Act in Ontario. In 1895 an Act
was passed in Ontario to enable mechanics&#8217; institutes to change
their names and transfer their property to municipalities on
condition that the libraries were made free to the public.</p>

<p>The <b>Australian</b> colonies have all passed separate laws, somewhat
similar to those in force in other parts of the Empire, in
regard to their adoption being left to local option, and rates
being more or less limited. In 1870 <span class="smcap">Victoria</span> passed an Act
establishing the Library, Museum and National Art Gallery at
Melbourne, and in 1885 &#8220;The Free Libraries Act&#8221; was passed.
But, in 1890, these Acts were repealed by &#8220;An Act to consolidate
the Laws relating to Libraries.&#8221; The Melbourne Public
Library, which was established in 1853, is now wholly supported
by Government, and it lends books to any municipality in the
colony. In addition, the Government make grants from public
funds to most of the mechanics&#8217; institutions, athen&aelig;ums and
other literary societies in Victoria.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">South Australia</span> has quite a body of library laws, dating
from 1863, when the South Australian Institution was incorporated,
but most of them have been repealed or incorporated
in the two principal Acts regulating institutes and free libraries.
By the various Acts passed in connexion with institutes or
literary societies, grants in aid are made by Parliament on lines
similar to those in force in the other colonies, while rules and
regulations are made and power given to transfer such institutes
to the municipalities. Public libraries are regulated by &#8220;An<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Act to establish Free Libraries in Corporate Towns and District
Councils,&#8221; 1898, subsequently amended by an Act of 1902.
This Act gives local authorities power, on the request and with
the consent of the ratepayers, to adopt the Act, subject to the
rate not exceeding 3d. in the &pound;. Municipal libraries are also
entitled to receive the same grants as are made to institutes.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">New South Wales</span> public libraries may be established
under the &#8220;Municipalities Act,&#8221; 1867. The Government makes
grants for the purchase of books on a scale according to population,
and other funds must be provided by the subscriptions of
members. Schools of art are entitled to receive a Government
grant in proportion to the amount of monetary support accorded
by the public. In addition, the Sydney Public Library (established
in 1869) is entirely supported by the Government, and
it sends out carefully selected boxes of books to 128 institutes
throughout New South Wales, the entire cost being defrayed
by Parliament.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap">Western Australia</span> grants are made to institutes as
in the other colonies, but there is no general Library Act in
existence yet. In 1887 the Government established a Public
Library at Perth, and contributes &pound;3000 per annum for its maintenance.
The only legislative enactment concerning libraries
in Western Australia is an Act for establishing a Law and Parliamentary
Library for the Legislature, which was passed in
1873 and amended in 1889.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Queensland</span> passed an &#8220;Act to consolidate and amend the
Laws relating to Municipal Institutions, and to provide more
effectually for local government,&#8221; 1878. This was extended
by the &#8220;Divisional Boards Act&#8221; of 1887, and now Municipal
Councils or Divisional Boards may make bye-laws for the establishment,
maintenance and management of public libraries.
Brisbane Free Public Library, the only library of importance
opened under this Act, has an annual grant from the municipal
funds varying from &pound;800 to &pound;1000. One hundred and forty
schools of art throughout the colony also receive Government
grants for library and other purposes to the extent of about
8s. 2d. for every pound subscribed by members.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tasmania</span> has a model library law, which is worthy of adoption
in every civilized country. It is contained in &#8220;An Act to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
amend the Law relating to Public Libraries,&#8221; passed in 1867.
It is so short, and so much to the point, that the whole of it
may be quoted. After a two-line preamble it declares that:
&#8220;The Municipal Council of every municipality may, from time
to time, apply such sum as it sees fit, out of the rates of such
municipality, in and towards the formation and maintenance
of Public Libraries within such municipality.&#8221; That is the
whole Act, and it gives no indication of the grudging limitations
which other countries inflict. The only blemish on this admirable
statute is the fact that it is not compulsory. Most of
the Tasmanian towns being small, only Hobart has put the
library law into force, by appropriating a penny rate to the
support of the Tasmanian Public Library (1849), which is also
maintained by Government grants. The small libraries throughout
Tasmania receive grants, on the usual conditions, from the
Government.</p>

<p>The library law of <span class="smcap">New Zealand</span> is based on a series of
Acts, similar to those passed in this country for the regulation
of municipal libraries and literary institutions. The principal
Acts are: (1) &#8220;An Act to promote the establishment of Public
Libraries,&#8221; 1869, giving power for the governing body of a city,
village or district to adopt the Act with the consent of the ratepayers,
and to levy a rate not exceeding 1d. in the &pound;; (2) &#8220;An
Act to confer powers on Public Libraries and Mechanics&#8217; Institutes,&#8221;
1875&mdash;a series of rules for incorporation and management;
(3) &#8220;An Act to promote the establishment and support
of Public Libraries,&#8221; 1877. In this Act it is laid down that the
grant for public libraries is to be apportioned among provincial
districts, in proportion to the population of such districts, and
that a subsidy equal to the amount of the library rate is to be
paid to municipal libraries established under the Act of 1869.
Free admission to reading-rooms is permitted, but no person to
be allowed to borrow unless he contributes not less than 5s. per
annum.</p>

<p>None of the <b>West Indian</b> dependencies have legislation relating
to libraries, although grants are paid from Government
funds towards the maintenance of libraries in different British
possessions.</p>

<p>In <b>India</b> the Government subsidizes only libraries connected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
with the leading departments of State, such as law and parliamentary
libraries for the use of legislators and the Councils
forming the Indian Government. It cannot be said to redound
to the credit of the Government that the only public library
systems in India have been established in native States. The
Gaekwar of Baroda has instituted such a system, which extends
from the capital city to the smallest village, and his example has
been followed by the native State of Indore.</p>

<p>The British colonial libraries are thus established and regulated
on lines very similar to the municipal libraries of this
country, and literary institutions of all kinds are incorporated
and recognized in the same way as in the United Kingdom.
There are numerous differences, however, in points of detail,
because, although the permissive clauses are retained for municipal
libraries in every case, in some cases, such as Tasmania
and South Australia, the rate limit is either non-existent or
greatly increased. Again, it is a universal provision in colonial
administration for the Governments to assist all kinds of libraries,
to the extent of contributing, within limits, as much money as
is raised by the subscriptions of members or produced by a
municipal library rate. Also, more attempt is made, especially
in Canada, to embody the libraries as part of the national system
of education, and in this respect our colonies are ahead of the
mother country.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec8">8.</h4>

<p><b>8.</b> The Library Legislation of the <b>United States</b> is of very
great importance, because of its variety, liberality and consistent
aim to make libraries an essential part of the system of
national education.</p>

<p>As Dr Thomas Bray was the first to procure library legislation
in England, so was he the first to obtain a law of this kind in
North America. He founded a library in South Carolina, which
in 1700 formed the subject of an Act passed by the Legislative
Assembly of South Carolina for its regulation and protection.
In 1715 a similar law for the same purpose was passed by the
Legislative Assembly of North Carolina. In subsequent years
many laws were passed by different States for the incorporation
and regulation of all kinds of social, subscription, mercantile
and other libraries, much on the same lines as were found necessary
in other countries, in order to give such associations legal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
standing and recognition. In some of the States laws have
been enacted providing for the payment of an annual grant to
proprietary libraries, on condition that they are made free to
the general public for reference purposes. This plan of utilizing
existing library facilities for the public benefit is common to
both the United States and our own colonies, and there are
many less effective ways of securing reading privileges at a
comparatively cheap rate. It would add enormously to the
educational resources of London, for example, if, in return for
an annual Government grant, the general public could have
access to the reading-rooms of some of the more important
literary, scientific and artistic libraries, especially those which
are rich in the current periodical literature of other countries.</p>

<p>In the &#8220;Report of the Commissioner of Education&#8221; for the
United States, 1895-96, vol. i., there is a very elaborate account
of the &#8220;Library Legislation in the United States,&#8221; to which
reference must be made by those who want minute details of
the laws of the different States of the Union. Here it is only
possible to deal with the laws affecting school and municipal
libraries, and to give typical examples of the legislation in each
class.</p>

<p>In 1835 the New York State Legislature passed a law establishing
libraries for the school districts of the State. These
libraries were much extended and improved by later laws, and
till 1853 they practically supplied the place of the public libraries.
Other States established these school district libraries, open to
scholars and all citizens, Massachusetts and Michigan following
in 1837, Connecticut in 1839, Iowa and Rhode Island in 1840,
and others at various dates down to 1876, when Colorado passed
a similar law. The failure of this system in many places led
to the first Town Library Law being passed by the Legislature
of Massachusetts in 1848, under which the City of Boston was
authorized to establish a free public library and levy a tax of
$5000, or &pound;1000, for its support. This was the first State law
passed in America, and in 1849 New Hampshire passed a general
law for the whole State. Massachusetts next extended its library
law from the City of Boston to the whole State in 1851, and Maine
followed in 1854. The other northern States followed slowly,
till now nearly all the States, save a few in the South and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
West, have laws enabling municipal libraries to be established.
Previous to this, most of the States, as they became incorporated
in the Union, established libraries for the use of the legislative
councils in the capital towns of each State, and these State
Libraries, as they are called, constitute a very important class
of public library in the United States. The first actual municipal
library opened in the United States was that of the town of
Peterboro&#8217;, in New Hampshire, which in 1833 established and
supported out of the local taxes a public library, which still
exists. From this it appears that there was nothing either in
the Federal or State law of the United States to prevent any
town from supporting a library at the public expense if it saw
fit. The principle of interference in local affairs by central
authorities is, however, a thoroughly Anglo-Saxon convention
or principle, and though the Federal Legislature in America
does not impose local laws on the State authorities, these
State legislatures impose the same restrictions upon local
municipal authorities which are common throughout the British
Empire.</p>

<p>The main provisions of the State Library Laws of America
are:</p>

<ul class="usliblaws">

<li>(1) The adoption of the library laws of the State by any city
or municipal council, with or without the petition or
consent of the ratepayers. The practice differs in the
various States, but it is permissive and not compulsory
in every State.</li>

<li>(2) Power to levy a rate for the establishment and support of
municipal libraries, varying from the fraction of a mill
per dollar on the taxable value of the town to any sum
the council may see fit to levy.</li>

<li>(3) Power to appoint trustees and do everything necessary
for the equipment and efficient administration of the
libraries.</li>

</ul>

<p class="blankbefore">It is important to note that in the United States the basis of
taxation is entirely different from what it is in this country.
Here rental, minus a certain deduction, is adopted as the unit
from which to make up the rateable value of a town. In the
United States the value of all property is taken, instead of mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
rental, as the unit from which the rateable value is built up. If
a house in England is worth &pound;420, and rents at &pound;36, it would be
assessed at about &pound;30, and the library rate would be levied upon
the &pound;30, producing 2s. 6d. In the United States the same house,
plus contents, would pay rates on the &pound;420, being the value of
the property, but on a smaller poundage. One mill on the dollar
is the thousandth part of 4s. 2d., or about one-twentieth of 1d.
If, therefore, the library rate in an American town is 1 mill, or
the twentieth of 1d., on the dollar, property valued at &pound;420, or
$2100, would pay a total library rate of about 8s. 6d. Other
classes of property, such as live stock, crops, etc., are also taxed,
so that in America the produce of even a comparatively small
library rate is much greater than in a town the same size in
England, and this fact should always be kept in mind when
comparisons are being made between the library systems of the
two countries.</p>

<p>There is one other point which should be mentioned as illustrative
of the difference of the methods of the United Kingdom
and the United States in regard to the adoption of the library
laws by municipalities. In those States of America where a
poll of the citizens is required before the libraries can be established,
no special vote is taken, but instead, at the annual election
of councillors, the voting papers bear the question: Are you in
favour of a library being established at a tax of &mdash;&mdash; mills on the
dollar? Thus at one election the municipal council is returned
to office, and their library policy dictated to them by the ratepayers.
The liberal library laws of the United States have
produced a great number of very large and magnificently
equipped public libraries, which are administered by well-educated
officers, who are paid adequate salaries for the work
they accomplish. No other country in the world can show
such a scheme of libraries closely in touch with all the other
educational bodies and recognized by the State as part of the
national system of education.</p>

<p>In one respect the library authorities in the United States
have shown more wisdom than those of other countries, by
establishing Boards of Library Commissioners charged with the
responsibility of supervising the library work of the whole of a
State. These Library Commissions are established in some of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the States, but not in all, and are generally composed of five
or six educational experts. They have power to advise in the
establishment of local libraries in every respect as regards selection
of books, cataloguing, etc., and may expend public money
in the purchase of books for libraries in towns which do not
possess municipal libraries. They are also authorized to pay
for all clerical work required in connexion with the Board, to
issue reports and collect statistics, and in some cases to organize
travelling libraries. All these State Library Commissions issue
handbooks, and those of New Jersey and Wisconsin will give
some idea of the important work in co-ordinating the library
forces of America now being accomplished by these Commissions.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec9">9.</h4>

<p><b>9.</b> No country in <b>Europe</b> has a library law like that in force
in Britain and the United States, but a certain amount of
recognition is accorded to public libraries by the State in most
countries. Municipal libraries exist in France under State
direction, but very few towns in other countries have done
much to foster public libraries in their midst; but in recent
years movements for the establishment of municipal libraries
on British or American lines have been initiated in several
European countries, and such libraries are now to be found in
Norway, Holland and Germany. In some cases endowed or
university or royal libraries are recognized or partly supported
by the State or the municipal authorities, but so far no European
nation has passed a general library law which gives communities
direct control of the establishment, organization and support of
public libraries by means of a tax or rate.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec10">10.</h4>

<p><b>10.</b> It is fitting to close this chapter with a brief reference to
<b>future library legislation in Great Britain</b>. The most urgent and
insistent need, without which further development is impossible,
is to remove or raise the limitation of one penny in the pound on
the library rate, which was fixed by the Act of 1855. Over
forty places, including nearly all the large towns, have acquired
extended rating powers by means of special local Acts, but such
a course is practically prohibitive in the small towns, where
relief is generally needed most. In view of the growth of the
demand for branch libraries, technical and commercial departments,
children&#8217;s reading-rooms, and for educational work in
many directions&mdash;extensions certainly never contemplated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
the original Acts&mdash;the penny limitation is an anachronism,
which it was the business of Parliament to have removed long
ago. Another anomaly which presses for remedy is that the
County Councils, alone of all the related local government
bodies, such as Borough and Urban District Councils, have no
expressed power of adopting the Libraries Acts. The consequence
has been detrimental to the establishment of village libraries.
A Parish Council may adopt the Acts, and a few parishes have
done so, but the yield of a penny rate in a parish is so small
that in most cases it is impossible to meet even necessary administrative
expenses, with nothing whatever left over for
books and papers. It is not surprising in these circumstances
that the rural population of the country is still deprived of the
social and educational advantages of the public library. What
is obviously indicated is a larger administrative authority, such
as the County Council, which could group the parishes, pool the
income from the rate, and administer from one centre a system
of travelling libraries, combined with local stationary collections
of books and the provision of suitable reading-rooms in the various
districts. Such schemes have been initiated in about a dozen
counties by the Carnegie United Kingdom Trust in conjunction
with the County Councils, but while the Scottish Education Act
of 1918 gives County Education Authorities power to provide
and maintain libraries, there is no mention of libraries in the
English Education Act of 1918. These and other needed reforms
in the library law are made in a Bill, now being promoted by
the Library Association, which every well-wisher of the movement
must hope will receive the sanction of the Legislature
without further delay.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec11">11.</h4>

<p><b>11.</b> The solution of the problem may, indeed, come from
another direction, as the present President of the Board of Education
(Mr H. A. L. Fisher) indicated in an interview with a
library deputation (April 1919) that the powers relating to
public libraries then held by the Local Government Board
were to be transferred to another department. The Board of
Education was thus indicated, and it may be that new sources
of support, means of co-ordination, and possibly periodical
Government inspection of libraries, may flow from the transfer;
but it is too early to speculate upon the matter.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="title">ADOPTION OF ACTS, FOUNDATION AND COMMITTEES</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec14">14. Methods of Adopting the Public Libraries Acts.</h4>

<p><b>14. Methods of Adopting the Public Libraries Acts.</b>&mdash;There are
only two methods prescribed by the Libraries Acts under which
public libraries can be established. In rural parishes a parish
meeting, called upon a requisition signed by ten or more voters
and held at the time and place appointed, may adopt the Acts
by a bare majority of those present and voting. At least seven
days&#8217; notice of the meeting must be given, but it is better to
allow a month. Should a poll be demanded, it must be conducted
by ballot according to the rules laid down by the
Local Government Board. Full particulars, including forms
of requisition, will be found in Chambers and Fovargue&#8217;s <i>Law
Relating to Public Libraries</i>, 1899.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec15">15.</h4>

<p><b>15.</b> As already stated in <a href="#Sec4">Section 4</a>, any county borough, urban
district, burgh or other similar authority may adopt the Libraries
Acts by a resolution of the council, without reference to the
voters. A month&#8217;s notice of motion must be given in the
customary form, and a bare majority of the council can pass the
resolution. A copy of the resolution adopting the Acts must
be sent to the Local Government Board, and it must also be
advertised in the local papers and posted on the doors of all the
churches and chapels&mdash;where such notices are usually posted.
It is best to make the resolution state a particular date when
the Acts are to come into operation, as is required by the Scotch
Act. In some places the Acts after being adopted have been
allowed to become a dead-letter owing to neglect of this necessary
precaution. As the urban districts and burghs are given power
to fix the amount of rate within the limitation of one penny, it
is not necessary to include in the resolution adopting the Acts
any stipulation as to the amount of rate. A useful form of
resolution is as follows:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>

<p class="fsize80 blankbefore">That the Public Libraries Act [<i>state date of principal Act</i>] and all
subsequent Acts amending the same be, and are hereby adopted, for the
county borough of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; [<i>state place</i>], and shall be in force throughout
the borough [<i>or other area</i>] on and after the .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. day of
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. [<i>state
year</i>].</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec16">16.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>16.</b> As the power of adopting the Acts in populous areas
is now vested in the local authorities, there is no longer, as
formerly, any need to educate opinion among ratepayers as to
the necessity for establishing public libraries. The Library
Association has issued a useful pamphlet, <i>The Establishment of
Public Libraries</i>, 1909, and most of the other propagandist
literature of a useful kind appears in the various books of Mr
Thomas Greenwood (<i>Public Libraries</i>, <i>British Library Year
Book</i>, etc.), and these should be consulted by anyone in a rural
parish who desires to raise the question in a practical form. As
regards urban districts the initiative may safely be left in the
hands of the intelligent members of council, who will sooner or
later move in the direction of placing their districts in line with
all the other large towns in the country.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec17">17.</h4>

<p><b>17.</b> At present about 534 towns and districts in the United
Kingdom have adopted the Public Libraries Acts, or local Acts,
and this number includes every large town in the country. The
principal areas still unprovided with public libraries are the
Metropolitan Borough of Marylebone and the towns and districts
of Bacup, Crewe, Scarborough, Swindon, Govan, Leith, Pollokshaws
and Wishaw; together with Dover, Jarrow, Llandudno
and Weymouth, which, though they have adopted the Acts,
have taken no steps to put them into force.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec18">18. Endowments.</h4>

<p><b>18. Endowments.</b>&mdash;Little need be said about the foundation
of public libraries by endowment or bequest. The wills of
Stephen Mitchell and George Baillie, of Glasgow, are models of
what a liberal bequest should be, both as regards the amounts
bequeathed and the conditions laid down for the formation of
the library itself. The practical condition attached to all the
gifts made by Mr Andrew Carnegie and Mr J. Passmore Edwards
for public library purposes should be adopted by every benefactor
who proposes to found a library. This is the very sensible
one that, if the gift of money is accepted by the community, the
local authority must adopt the Public Libraries Acts, in order
to maintain the library in a state of efficiency for all time. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
only alteration suggested in the form of future bequests is that,
when money is offered to a small town on the condition that it
adopts the Libraries Acts, the whole of the gift should not necessarily
take the form of a building fund. Small towns usually
have very inadequate incomes from the library rate, and for
this reason it might be wise if a fair proportion of the gift were
directed to be invested as a book fund. A large library building
without books is by no means as useful to the people as a much
less ambitious building provided with a fund which permits of
the annual purchase of &pound;50 to &pound;100 worth of books, independently
of the library rate. At the same time, the endowment of libraries
in the manner suggested would not always act as an encouragement
to town councils to provide proper funds for libraries;
indeed, it might act as an excuse for withholding them.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec19">19. Appointment of Committees.</h4>

<p><b>19. Appointment of Committees.</b>&mdash;The first step after the
Libraries Acts have been adopted by a local authority will be
the appointment of a committee, and it is desirable that only
capable men should be elected. The best interests of the library
will be served by a committee consisting of good business men
and literary or professional men or women, in about equal proportions.
It is quite evident that the legislature did not contemplate
the formation of public libraries by committees consisting
exclusively of the rank and file of local authorities, who
are chiefly concerned with paving, drainage and other equally
material matters. By Section 15, Sub-section 3, of the &#8220;Public
Libraries Act, 1892,&#8221; it is ordained that &#8220;an urban authority
may if it think fit appoint a committee and delegate to it all or
any of its powers and duties under this section, and the said
committee shall to the extent of such delegation be deemed to
be the library authority. Persons appointed to be members of
the committee need not be a member of the urban authority.&#8221;
The &#8220;Public Libraries (Ireland) Amendment Act, 1877,&#8221; gives
similar power to elect members outside the local authority.
Section 4 ordains that &#8220;the committee in which the general
management, regulation and control of such libraries, museums
or schools may be vested under the provisions of the 12th Section
of the principal Act may consist in part of persons not members
of the council or board or commissioners.&#8221; By the &#8220;Public
Libraries Consolidation (Scotland) Act, 1887,&#8221; Section 18 ordains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that the local authority shall &#8220;appoint a committee, consisting
of not less than ten nor more than twenty members, half of whom
shall be chosen from amongst the magistrates and council, or
board, as the case may be, and the remaining half from amongst
the householders of the burgh or parish other than the magistrates
and council, or board, and three members of such committee
shall form a quorum.&#8221; It is further ordained, Section 21,
that this committee &#8220;shall manage, regulate and control all
libraries and museums established under this Act, or to which
this Act applies; and shall have power to do all things necessary
for such management.&#8221; It is thus clear that local authorities
are fully empowered to select the best expert advice it is possible
to obtain in the district, and that the administration of the
library should not rest entirely in the hands of the local authority.
It is therefore advisable that library committees, while consisting
of a majority of members of the local authority, should be
strengthened by a good proportion of members selected from
among the best qualified citizens. The principle of co-option is
compulsory in the case of Education Committees, and so far as
this principle is concerned the arguments for its adoption on
Library Committees are equally cogent.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec20">20. Constitution of Committees.</h4>

<p><b>20. Constitution of Committees.</b>&mdash;The portions of the Acts
already quoted make it plain that in Scotland the library committees
shall be independent bodies, with power to provide
everything necessary, without requiring the sanction of the local
authorities, or doing more than from time to time reporting
their proceedings. In Ireland, under Section 12 of the principal
Act, &#8220;the general management, regulation and control of such
libraries and museums, etc., shall be, as to any borough, vested
in and exercised by the council or board, and as to any town, in
and by the town commissioners, <i>or such committee as they respectively
may from time to time appoint, who may from time to time
purchase and provide the necessary fuel, books, appoint and dismiss
officers, make rules</i>,&#8221; etc. This approximates closely to the
English law, which differs from that of the Scottish in leaving
the power of appointing an independent or semi-independent
library committee in the discretion of the local authority. The
English Act has already been quoted in the previous section,
and it now remains to give reasons why every Public Library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Committee should be independent of the control of the local
authority, save for certain purposes. The fact that, in Scotland,
the hybrid composition of the committee is regarded as a reason
for making it practically independent of the local authority
offers a strong argument in favour of a similar course being
pursued in England and Ireland. A mixed committee is entitled
to act without the special sanction of the local authority, if only
for the reason that all its members cannot take part in the
ratifying proceedings of the council or board. It seems illogical
to invite capable citizens who are not members of the council
to pass certain resolutions and then submit them for confirmation
to a council on which they have no vote or voice. Furthermore,
a committee of any kind appointed to administer an Act,
like the Public Libraries Act, which lays down clearly what may
be done and how much may be expended, does not require the
same kind of oversight and control as an ordinary committee
appointed for some municipal purpose with comparatively
unlimited powers of expenditure. No committee appointed
for an educational purpose should be subject to the delays and
difficulties caused by having to submit all its proceedings for
confirmation by a superior authority. All these arguments
furnish reasons why local authorities in England and Ireland
should follow Scotland in giving Public Library Committees
a complete or partial delegation of powers under the Public
Libraries Acts.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec21">21. Delegation of Powers.</h4>

<p><b>21. Delegation of Powers.</b>&mdash;A delegation of powers under the
various sections of the Acts quoted should provide for a fair
measure of independence for the committee, with a fair share of
general control on the part of the local authority. As a matter
of policy, as well as in the public interest, it is very desirable
to maintain harmonious relations between a central board and
its acting committees, and for these reasons information as to
the proceedings of a committee should always be available, if
required. But, for the reasons already set forth, a Public Library
Committee should be a <i>reporting</i> and not merely a <i>recommending</i>
body. With the exception of public libraries in the Metropolitan
Boroughs, which are compelled by Section 8 (3) of the &#8220;London
Government Act, 1899,&#8221; to receive the sanction of the Borough
Council and its Finance Committee for expenditures over &pound;50,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
every Public Library Committee in England and Ireland should
be constituted under a special delegation of powers, such as was
contemplated and authorized by the Acts already quoted. A
fair and workable form of delegation of powers, which has been
adopted with good results, is as follows:</p>

<p class="fsize80 blankbefore">That the [<i>name of authority</i>] hereby delegates to the Public Library
Committee all the powers and duties vested in it as the Library Authority
under the Public Libraries Acts, 1892, and all subsequent amendments,
with the following reservations<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<ul class="reservations">

<li>1. The sanction and raising of loans for new buildings or other
purposes.</li>

<li>2. The making and collection of the annual library rate.</li>

<li>3. The confirmation of agreements with adjoining library authorities
for the joint use of libraries.</li>

<li>4. The confirmation of the appointment or dismissal of the librarian.</li>

<li>5. The sanction of any scheme for the formation of branch libraries.</li>

<li>6. The proceedings of the Public Library Committee to be reported
monthly to the [<i>name of authority</i>], but only for confirmation
and sanction as regards Clauses 1 to 5 of this constitution.</li>

<li>7. The librarian to act as clerk to the Public Library Committee.</li>

</ul>

<p>As regards Metropolitan Borough Councils, it may be desirable
to add a clause to the effect that no expenditure exceeding &pound;50
be incurred without an estimate being first obtained by the
Finance Committee of the Borough Council. But it is doubtful,
if even this restriction is necessary, if, when the rate is made,
the Borough Finance Committee passes an estimate for the whole
amount of the public library rate, to be expended on general
library purposes according to a budget or scheme prepared by
the Public Library Committee. This will get over the difficulty
of having to obtain fresh estimates every time &pound;50 worth of
books is ordered. The &#8220;Public Libraries Act (Amendments)
Act, 1901,&#8221; contains a clause making it quite clear that for library
purposes a Metropolitan Borough is an urban district.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec22">22. Standing Orders.</h4>

<p><b>22. Standing Orders.</b>&mdash;The standing orders or bye-laws regulating
Public Library Committees need not be very elaborate.
Generally, they should be the same as those governing other
committees of the local authority, with the exceptions as to
powers. The committee should be elected annually by the local
authority, and the number of members should be small rather
than large. The needs of districts differ, but a Public Library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Committee of over twelve may be an encumbrance rather than
a help to the institution. At the same time a larger committee
means a larger representation on the Council, and help from more
people who are actually or nominally interested in the library
service. Probably the largest committee in England is that at
Wallasey, which has thirty members, of whom thirteen are
Council members. Where such large committees exist it is
usually found that the actual executive work devolves upon a
sub-committee, such as the Book Sub-Committee. Meetings
are generally held once a month; certainly there is ordinarily
no occasion for the committee to be called more often, and in
some towns a quarterly meeting is found to be sufficient. A
chairman should be elected annually by the committee; he
should invariably be a Council member, as he is the natural
representative of the committee on the Council; but the vice-chairman
may fittingly be a co-opted member. The principle
of a constant change of chairmen, adopted in some Councils, is
a bad one on a Library Committee, as the work is quite different,
in many respects, from other departments of the public service,
and knowledge and experience are required if a sound and
consistent library policy is to be pursued. This is impossible
under a system in which chairmen come and go annually. The
same remarks apply to the committee as a whole; its personnel
should remain reasonably stable. Three members should form
a quorum. The committee should control its own clerk, who
ought to be the librarian, although, as we have implied, this is
by no means generally the case, and, indeed, is sometimes impossible
under the standing orders of the Council. The Public
Libraries Acts require that a separate account be kept of receipts
and expenditure from the library rate, and library committees
should see that this is done in all cases where the accounts are
kept and payments made by the Council officials.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec23">23. Duties of Committees.</h4>

<p><b>23. Duties of Committees.</b>&mdash;To a considerable extent these
are fixed by the delegation of powers granted and the standing
orders adopted. But there are certain broad principles which
should be observed by library committees in the ultimate interest
of their work. The chief of these is that the committee is concerned
rather with library policy than with library administration;
with what shall be done rather than with how it shall be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
done. The administration, planning, arrangement, methods,
etc., of a library are technical matters purely appertaining to
the librarian; and many libraries are stultified by well-meant
and conscientious interference in details of this character by
library committees. The committee has the right, and it is its
duty, to expect the results of its policy to be visibly effective in
the library service, but it should confide the means of obtaining
those results to its librarian; only in this way can the special
training which librarians now bring to their work be made of
maximum use to the community. With the modifications
implied in these principles the duties of the committee cover:</p>

<ul class="commduties">

<li>1. General oversight of buildings, staff and the work of the various departments
of the library.</li>

<li>2. Careful supervision of the selection of books.</li>

<li>3. Compilation and revision of public rules and regulations.</li>

<li>4. Regular checking of accounts and expenditures, including those of all
officers.</li>

<li>5. Regular meetings on fixed dates.</li>

<li>6. Every member of committee should become acquainted with the
elements of public library administration, and for this purpose should
possess copies of all the live Acts of Parliament.</li>

</ul>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec24">24.</h4>

<p><b>24.</b> To cover the work effectively, various sub-committees are
necessary, which should be small, but large enough to give each
member of the committee an actual interest in some definite
department of library work. Usually the sub-committees
appointed include a <i>Book</i> Sub-Committee, which undertakes
the examining of all lists of books suggested for purchase; an
<i>Accounts</i> Sub-Committee, to which all financial matters are
committed; and a <i>Staff</i> Sub-Committee, which is concerned
with the appointment, dismissal, remuneration, and training of
the employees. Some of the large libraries have a <i>Buildings</i>
Sub-Committee to regulate the proper maintenance of library
properties; <i>Lectures and Extension</i> Sub-Committee; <i>Branches</i>
Sub-Committee; and such other groupings as the local circumstances
warrant. In most cases, however, the needs of the
authority are met by the three sub-committees first-named;
and the multiplying of sub-committees is not desirable where
there is not enough business to keep them interested and
occupied.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="title">FINANCE, LOANS AND ACCOUNTS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec27">27. The Library Rate.</h4>

<p><b>27. The Library Rate.</b>&mdash;The general library Acts passed for
Ireland, Scotland and England all limit the amount to be raised
by rate for library purposes to one penny in the pound on the
annual rateable rental of all properties within the areas, with
certain exceptions or modifications as to gardens and agricultural
lands. Great doubt exists as to what is meant by a penny
rate and on what value it is to be levied. Some authorities
maintain that the income from a penny rate can only represent
the net sum realized by a penny on the rateable value, after all
deductions have been made on account of empty houses and
other irrecoverable items. Against this may be set the actual
practice in several places, of paying over the full sum which a
penny rate on the nominal rateable value would produce, without
any deductions whatsoever. As the Public Libraries Acts
have placed a limitation on the amount of the library rate, it
may be assumed that the libraries were intended to benefit to
the full extent of the rateable value. At any rate the Acts are
silent on the point, and practice differs so much that it is fair to
say that a public library, because of the present limitation, and
because some places now give the full product, is entitled to the
full amount which a penny rate would yield when calculated on
the full rateable value of the town or district, without deduction
of any kind, either for unproductive properties or cost of collection.
It has been decided that no deduction can be made from
the income produced by the library rate on account of the cost
of collection, and as this rate is now collected as part of a general
or other unlimited rate, it seems unfair to saddle it with any part
of the cost of collection. If it were collected as a separate rate,
or with rates similarly limited by Act of Parliament, the position
would be different. The difference between the amount paid
over to public libraries and the actual sums which would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
produced were the rate charged on the full rateable value is
sometimes considerable. The losses range from over 20 to 5
per cent., and thus a considerable limit is placed upon the book-purchasing
power of a large number of libraries.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec28">28. Unexpended Balances.</h4>

<p><b>28. Unexpended Balances.</b>&mdash;In some places the local authority
has appropriated unexpended balances of the public library
rate and applied them to other local purposes. This action is
clearly illegal, and could only have been taken by those who are
ignorant of the decisions of the Local Government Board on the
point. It is true the Acts do not specify how unexpended
balances of the library rate are to be dealt with, but it is equally
true that as the money was raised under a special Act for a strictly
defined purpose, it cannot be diverted to any other purpose, nor
can it be carried forward as a portion of the library rate for a
succeeding year. No doubt the wording of the Act is responsible
for the interpretation which has been put upon the section
entitled &#8220;Limitations on expenditure for purpose of Act.&#8221; It
reads: &#8220;A rate or addition to a rate shall not be levied for the
purposes of this Act for any one financial year in any library
district to an amount exceeding one penny in the pound.&#8221; The
Local Government Board have decided that any unexpended
balances of the library income must be carried forward to next
year&#8217;s library account, without prejudice to the next year&#8217;s
library income. This decision has been upheld by all the district
auditors of the Local Government Board, and it is difficult to
understand the reason why a few places still cling to the belief
that the library rate can be further limited by this illegal procedure
of appropriating unexpended balances. Committees who
are threatened with this action can always protect themselves
against the injustice by taking care that there are no balances
to appropriate; but it will prevent them from saving a little
money for necessary book purchases, cleaning or other purposes.
It should be pointed out, furthermore, that the section of the
Act above quoted does not really refer to the total <i>amount</i> to be
raised by rate in a given year, but only to the <i>poundage</i> or rate
which may be charged for library purposes, namely, not more
than a penny in the pound. The question of the <i>product</i> of this
rate of a penny is not mentioned anywhere in the Acts, and it
is this lack of clear definition&mdash;the failure to distinguish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
amount of a rate from the total amount which it will produce
annually&mdash;which is responsible for many of the difficulties
hitherto met with in administering the Libraries Acts.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec29">29. Annual Estimates.</h4>

<p><b>29. Annual Estimates.</b>&mdash;The Scotch principal Act is the only
one which requires an annual estimate or budget to be prepared
by the library authority for the information of the local authority.
Section 30 of the Act of 1887 provides that &#8220;The Committee
shall in the month of April in every year make up, or cause to
be made up, an estimate of the sums required in order to defray
the interest of any money borrowed, the payment of the sinking
fund, and the expense of maintaining and managing all libraries
and museums under its control for the year after Whitsunday
then next to come, and for the purpose of purchasing the books,
articles and things authorized by this Act,&#8221; etc. This estimate
has to be submitted to the local authority, who &#8220;shall provide
the amount required out of the library rate to be levied by it,
and shall pay over to the committee the sum necessary for the
annual expenditure by it in terms of its estimate.&#8221; By the
standing orders of most local authorities yearly or half-yearly
estimates have to be prepared and submitted by the various
committees, and as practice varies everywhere, it will be well
for the library authority to follow the local practice.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec30">30.</h4>

<p><b>30.</b> Local circumstances alter the conditions materially in
every place, and hitherto there has been a lack of uniformity
in presenting financial statements which makes any attempt
to produce a model budget to be suspect. The form of the
statement is often governed by the practice of the Borough
Accountant, who arranges the order of items in accordance with
his own views; but wherever it is possible to do so, it would be
well if the form of annual estimate conformed with the order
adopted in the report made by Professor W. G. S. Adams to the
Carnegie United Kingdom Trust in 1915, <i>On Library Provision
and Policy</i>, which would arrange in some such order as in the
table on <a href="#Page_46">page 46</a>.</p>

<p>Each of these items will probably need analysis, and the order
given here may be inverted; indeed, the form shown is merely
meant to be suggestive and to show the nature of the information
which the Council usually requires when it is considering
the annual estimates.</p>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>31.</b> The distribution of the income over the various items is
again subject to local circumstances; but, thanks to the inquiry
of Professor Adams, a <a href="#Fig2">table</a> of comparative distribution of
income drawn from the figures of about 500 library systems
throughout the kingdom has been published, which gives the
best information at present available. It is qualified by the
facts we have emphasized in the last paragraph, and still more
by the changed conditions which result from the European War,
which have increased such items as salaries, and reduced the
book-purchasing (and indeed every other purchasing) power of
libraries considerably. We give the table of percentages of
expenditure for libraries with, and without, loans, merely
remarking that it may serve as a rough guide by which library
committees may work. Again, the librarian, in submitting his
budget for the use of his committee, will analyse the items into
general administrative, central, reference and branch libraries&#8217;
expenditure, and under each will show salaries as distinct from
wages paid for unskilled service; and books will be divided
into &#8220;new,&#8221; &#8220;replacements,&#8221; etc.; periodicals into those filed
permanently and others; maintenance charges into building
expenses, furniture and fittings, stationery, repairs to fabric and
furniture, and so on. The Council as a rule does not require
so detailed a statement.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 2.</span>&mdash;Returns compiled from Professor Adams&#8217;
Report on Library Provision and Policy
[Carnegie United Kingdom Trust], <a href="#Sec31">Sec. 31</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec32">32.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>32.</b> We must consider in some detail the principal expenditures
to which library committees are subject.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec33">33. Loans.</h4>

<p><b>33. Loans.</b>&mdash;The Libraries Acts give fairly full instructions as
to loans for public library purposes. In England under the
principal Act &#8220;every library authority, with the sanction of
the Local Government Board .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. may borrow money for the
purposes of this Act on the security of any fund or rate applicable
for those purposes.&#8221; In parishes the regulations for borrowing
prescribed by the &#8220;Local Government Act, 1894,&#8221; are to
apply. As a preliminary to borrowing, an inquiry is held locally
by a Local Government Board inspector, who receives evidence
as to proposed buildings, sites, amount required, etc., and also
hears objections to the proposal. The Local Government Board
print bills announcing the inquiry, and these must be posted
and paid for by the library authority. At such inquiries full
particulars should be prepared as to income, date of adopting
Acts, etc., as well as particulars of the proposed scheme. After
the inquiry is held it is generally about three months later
before the sanction of the Board is received. This states the
amount sanctioned and for what period the money can be
borrowed for sites, buildings, furniture or books, as the case
may be.</p>

<p>The security for loans is declared by the &#8220;Public Health Act,
1875,&#8221; Section 233, to be the &#8220;credit of any fund or all or any
rates or rate out of which they are authorized to defray expenses
incurred by them in the execution of this Act.&#8221; And it is
further laid down that &#8220;they may mortgage to the persons by
or on behalf of whom such sums are advanced any such fund
or rates or rate.&#8221; It thus appears that neither library buildings
nor the library rate can be mortgaged for the purposes of library
loans, but only the rate or rates out of which the expenses of the
Public Health Act are paid. This practically means the general
rate of a district.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec34">34.</h4>

<p><b>34.</b> The Local Government Board will fix the period for which
sums of money for particular purposes may be borrowed.
Generally the periods are as follows:</p>

<p>The money may be borrowed from the Public Works Loan
Commissioners, County Councils, Banks, Friendly Societies or
private individuals. The rate of interest varies, according to
the state of the money market. Four per cent. may be regarded
as an average interest at present, but library authorities have
borrowed for as low as 3 per cent.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="noindent"><a name="Footnote_1" id="Footnote_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a>
A loan for purchasing an existing building will not be sanctioned by
the Local Government Board for a period exceeding twenty or twenty-five
years.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec35">35.</h4>

<p><b>35.</b> The methods of repayment vary, and this must be entirely
a matter for local arrangement, and should follow the practice
in vogue with other municipal loans. An equalized repayment
of principal and interest on the annuity system has the advantage
of distributing the payments uniformly over the whole
period, and of placing part of the burden on succeeding ratepayers
as well as upon those who establish the library. This is
much fairer than making the pioneer ratepayers practically bear
the whole foundation cost of establishing an institution which
increases in its value to the community as it progresses. On the
other hand, buildings are sure to depreciate in value, and the
question of repairs is a constant one, so that some authorities
maintain that loans on structures should be paid off by annually
diminishing instalments of principal and interest. In Scotland
repayments of principal must be made from a sinking fund
which is to be formed from a certain proportion of the rate put
aside annually.</p>

<p>The arrangements for negotiating a loan and drawing up the
necessary deeds should be placed in the hands of a solicitor, but
in many cases the accountant or town clerk of the district is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
responsible for all arrangements, and will see that the deed is
duly sealed as prescribed by the Act.</p>

<p>In connexion with this it should be noted that by Section 237
of the &#8220;Public Health Act, 1875,&#8221; a register of the mortgages
on each rate must be kept, and that &#8220;within fourteen days after
the date of any mortgage an entry shall be made in the register
of the number and date thereof, and of the names and description
of the parties thereto, as stated in the deed.&#8221; Furthermore,
&#8220;every such register shall be open to public inspection during
office hours at the said office [local authority&#8217;s office] without
fee or reward.&#8221; As the auditor will call for this register, the
clerk to the library authority should see that it is provided, if
the local authority has not already done so.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec36">36.</h4>

<p><b>36.</b> The arrangements for loans in Ireland and Scotland are
somewhat similar to those just described. In Ireland no power
to borrow was given under the principal Act, but the Amendment
Act of 1877 gives the power, provided the commissioners
of His Majesty&#8217;s Treasury approve. The Commissioners of
Public Works in Ireland may lend, and power is given to mortgage,
as security, either the borough fund, town fund, or the
library rate itself. In Scotland the local authority may borrow,
without any other consent, on mortgage or bond on the security
of the library rate, a sum or sums not exceeding the capital sum
represented by one-fourth part of the library rate, capitalized
at the rate of twenty years&#8217; purchase of such sum. A sinking
fund must be formed, consisting of an annual sum equal to one-fiftieth
part of the money borrowed, which is to be invested and
applied to the purpose of extinguishing the debt.</p>

<p>Before leaving the question of loans, it may be well to offer a
word of warning against the danger of overborrowing, which has
very seriously crippled the work of various libraries. In some
places as much as one-half the library income has to be devoted
to the repayment of principal and interest of loans; in others,
one-third is similarly spent. One-fourth is the maximum which
in any case should be set apart for the purpose.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec37">37. Assessment to Rates and Taxes.</h4>

<p><b>37. Assessment to Rates and Taxes.</b>&mdash;The assessment of public
library buildings to rates and taxes has been for long a burning
question, and is still far from final settlement. The limitation
of the library rate to a penny in the pound has always been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
considered by library authorities a strong reason why all additional
burdens on the meagre income raised thereby should be
resisted. But all local authorities and assessment committees
did not think likewise, and a good deal of friction resulted.</p>

<p>In 1843 was passed &#8220;An Act to exempt from County, Borough,
Parochial, and other Local Rates, Land and Buildings occupied
by Scientific or Literary Societies,&#8221; 6 &amp; 7 Vict., c. 36, under
which a few public libraries obtained certificates of exemption
from the payment of local rates, from the Registrar of Friendly
Societies, as allowed by this Act. Some of these certificates
were recognized by the rating authorities, others were ignored,
and it was frequently maintained that a public library was not
a scientific or literary society within the meaning of the Act.
In 1896, however, a complete change took place as regards this
point, by a decision of the House of Lords, which ruled that
public libraries were literary societies or institutions for the
purposes of the &#8220;Income Tax Act of 1842,&#8221; under which such
institutions were granted exemption from the payment of income
tax. Although the case, brought by the Corporation of
Manchester against the Surveyor of Income Tax for Manchester,
did not directly refer to the Act of 1843, the decision that public
libraries were literary institutions effected all that was necessary
for the purpose of claiming exemption from local rates under
the &#8220;Literary Societies Act of 1843.&#8221; A full report of this case
and decision is printed in the <i>Library</i> for 1896, in the <i>Times</i>
law reports and elsewhere. The effect of this decision was to
remove any doubt from the mind of the Registrar of Friendly
Societies, who has power under the Act to grant certificates
exempting public libraries from the payment of local rates, and
as a result many libraries obtained certificates, and now enjoy
complete or partial exemption. It is not necessary to quote the
Act of 1843, which can be obtained for one penny from the King&#8217;s
printers, but the procedure requisite for obtaining a certificate
of exemption may be noted.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec38">38.</h4>

<p><b>38.</b> An application claiming exemption under the 1843 Act
must be addressed to the Registrar of Friendly Societies at
London, Edinburgh or Dublin, as the case may require. With
this must be enclosed a copy of the rules and regulations of the
library, signed by the chairman and three members of committee,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and countersigned by the clerk or librarian. These rules must
include the following, or others in similar terms<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. &#8220;The &mdash;&mdash; Public Library is a society established for
purposes of literature and science exclusively.&#8221;</p>

<p>2. &#8220;The library is supported in part by a rate levied in
accordance with the Public Libraries Acts, and in part by annual
voluntary contributions of money and gifts of books and periodicals.
The Library Committee shall not make any dividend, gift,
division or bonus in money unto or between any of the members.&#8221;</p>

<p>These two rules are absolutely necessary to a successful application,
and, if not already incorporated, should be included by
special resolution of the library authority before application is
made. It is best to send printed copies of the rules, and it
should be noted that three identical copies, all signed, must be
sent. On these the registrar endorses his certificate, and sends
one to the Clerk of the Peace for the district, one to the library
authority, and retains one. The form of certificate usually
attached is as follows:</p>

<p class="fsize80 blankbefore">It is hereby certified that this society is entitled to the benefit of the
Act 6 &amp; 7 Vict., c. 36, intituled &#8220;An Act to exempt from County, Borough,
Parochial and other Local Rates, Lands and Buildings occupied by
Scientific or Literary Societies.&#8221;</p>

<p class="leftsig fsize80">Date.</p>

<div class="scr">

<p class="circlestamp">

<div class="hh">

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/seal.png" alt="seal" width="100" height="101" />
</div>

</div><!--hh-->

<p>The application should show that annual voluntary contributions
of money, books and periodicals are received, but there is no
direction laid down as to the amount of voluntary contributions
which will pass muster. The point is somewhat vague, but it
may be assumed that the amount received from gifts, subscriptions,
sales, books, periodicals, etc., need not form a substantial
proportion of the income. As the English Registrar accepts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
donations in kind as annual voluntary contributions, it is only
necessary to value these to make up a respectable sum.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec39">39.</h4>

<p><b>39.</b> Certificates are not granted as a rule in cases where a
charge for admission is made. Furthermore, it is doubtful if
the exemption from local rates would be allowed by hostile
local authorities for any occupied portions of library buildings.
A caretaker&#8217;s or librarian&#8217;s residence would in all probability be
separately assessed, if the certificate were otherwise recognized.
By a decision of a Court of Quarter Sessions at Liverpool in
1905, it has been decided that the Corporation of Liverpool is
liable for local rates on a library building; but it is not possible
to say how far this may affect libraries holding these certificates.
Legislation is pending, and till something is definitely settled,
the question must remain open.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec40">40.</h4>

<p><b>40.</b> The House of Lords&#8217; <a href="#Sec37">decision</a> already noticed also freed
public library buildings from income tax, but it should be distinctly
understood that inhabited house duty can be charged for
the whole of a building, even if only partly occupied as a residence,
when included under one roof, unless it can be shown
that the library and residence do not communicate directly with
each other.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec41">41. Insurance.</h4>

<p><b>41. Insurance.</b>&mdash;Library buildings and their contents should
be fully insured against fire. To ascertain insurable value take
the cost of buildings at the contract price, including all charges
which would have to be incurred again for rebuilding; furniture
at the contract price; lending library books at 3s. 4d. per volume
all over; and reference library books at 5s. per volume all over,
and thus obtain a total. An allowance is sometimes made for
depreciation, but a full covering value is always safe. The policy
will state these various items separately for the purposes of insurance,
but will likely charge a uniform percentage on all.
1s. 6d. per cent. is a fair charge in a good office, but insurances
can be effected for as low as 1s. 3d. per cent. Library buildings
form a safe risk, and unless in a case of temporary premises with
bad surroundings, 1s. 6d. per cent. should be regarded as a
maximum charge. Some offices return the premium once in
five years or so by way of bonus. Insurance policies should be
revised every few years to keep pace with the growth of the
library. Paintings, valuable MSS. and rare books must be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
the subject of special insurances. The same may be said of
temporary exhibitions, especially of loan articles, which ought
to be covered by a policy for the period of the show. Plenty of
fire-buckets should be provided in public library buildings to
cope with the first outbreak of fire. Hydrants, save in large
buildings, are not necessary, on account of their cost and
practical inutility. If a fire cannot be checked at its onset by
means of buckets, it is time to ring up the fire-brigade.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec42">42.</h4>

<p><b>42.</b> Another insurance that should be provided is against
claims for damage or injury to children who use juvenile departments
which may be caused through any defect in the building
or its fittings; and in connexion therewith it should be remembered
that children cannot legally be held contributory by their
carelessness or misbehaviour to such accidents as would cause
injury.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec43">43.</h4>

<p><b>43.</b> Health insurance must be paid by the library committees
for all employees of sixteen years of age and more who earn less
than &pound;250 a year.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec44">44. Contracts, Agreements, Requisitions.</h4>

<p><b>44. Contracts, Agreements, Requisitions.</b>&mdash;Contracts for regular
supplies should be renewed annually. The principal items of
this kind are:</p>

<p class="hind2_4 blankbefore">Books, bookbinding, periodicals and newspapers, printing,
stationery, cleaning materials.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">Local sentiment is generally in favour of procuring all supplies
locally, where possible, and when this can be done without
absolute disadvantage to the library it is the most convenient
course. Tenders can be invited either by public advertisement
or on the nomination of members of committee and the librarian.
To begin with, public advertisement is, perhaps, the fairest way;
afterwards, quality of service and other considerations will decide.
Specifications should be prepared and sent out according to
requirements.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec45">45.</h4>

<p><b>45.</b> All specifications and contracts should be carefully preserved.
The former should be entered up in a specification
book, which need be but an ordinary foolscap folio blank book,
ruled faint. Accepted contracts should either be filed in boxes
or guard books, or copied into a contracts book similar to the
specification book. Accepted estimates for occasional work<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
should be fastened to the accounts. It is important to be able
to lay hands on any given document or its terms without the
slightest delay. All tenders for regular supplies and estimates
for occasional work should be opened in committee, in meeting
duly convened, unless by special resolution the librarian or a
sub-committee is authorized to deal with them. Envelopes,
printed with the address of the library and having the words
&#8220;Tender for &mdash;&mdash;&#8221; printed boldly in one corner, should be
enclosed with all invitations for estimates to prevent the risk
of accidental opening.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec46">46.</h4>

<p><b>46.</b> In connexion with contracts it is important to note that
Public Library Committees and officers are subject to the penal
provisions of the &#8220;Public Bodies Corrupt Practices Act, 1889,&#8221;
52 &amp; 53 Vict., c. 69, in the event of bribes or commissions being
given or received in connexion with pending contracts or supplies.
As this does not seem to be generally known, the essential
words of the Act are quoted:</p>

<p class="fsize80 blankbefore">&#8220;Every person who corruptly solicits or receives, or agrees to receive,
for himself, or for any other person, any gift, loan, fee, reward, or advantage,
as an inducement to any member, officer, or servant of a public body,
doing or forbearing to do anything in respect of any matter or transaction
in which such public body is concerned; and every person who shall, with
the like object, corruptly give, promise, or offer any gift, loan, fee, reward,
or advantage to any person, whether for the benefit of that person or of
another, shall be guilty of a misdemeanour. Any one convicted of such
an offence shall be liable to imprisonment for two years, or to a fine of
&pound;500, or to both imprisonment and fine; and, in addition, be liable to pay
to such public body the amount or value of any gift, loan, fee, or reward
so received by him; and be adjudged incapable of holding any public
office for seven years, and to forfeit any such office held by him,&#8221; etc.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec47">47.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>47.</b> <span class="smcap">Agreements</span> for leases, loans, joint use of libraries with
adjoining authorities, or between committee and librarian or
other persons, should be drawn up by a solicitor. Minor agreements
may be drawn up by the library authority, but they should
all be stamped with a sixpenny stamp if in connexion with a
consideration of &pound;5 and over. The legal limits within which
agreements between various kinds of library authorities can be
made are duly set forth in the various Public Libraries Acts,
and, as these matters seldom arise in the course of ordinary
library routine, there is no need further to consider the subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec48">48. Suggestions on Management.</h4>

<p><b>48. Suggestions on Management.</b>&mdash;It is well to keep a book
or to provide forms to enable readers to make suggestions on
the management of the library. Frequently such suggestions
take the form of complaints, but it is a useful thing to allow free
opportunity for the expression of public opinion. In some
libraries separate books are kept for propositions of new books
not in the library and suggestions on management. A simple
form, on which the reader can make suggestions on management
or of books, is preferable. When these forms are made
readily available, and are kept in public view, together with a
locked box in which the slips can be lodged through a slit in the
lid, they are much more effective as a means of drawing suggestions
than special MS. books which have to be asked for. A
useful form of slip is the following<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="blankbefore">A small locked box to contain these, and lettered on side
&#8220;Suggestions,&#8221; should be provided. If one of these boxes is
placed in each important department of the library, readers
will be encouraged to air their views. Even if nothing more
valuable should be received than a complaint about a draught
or the manner of the librarian, it is better than the dull indifference
and apathy which are met with in libraries where readers
are discouraged from taking any part in the administration.
Occasionally some brilliant, if impossible, suggestions on management<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
are received by means of these slips and boxes, and
suggestions of desirable books can always be depended upon.
Every means of interesting readers in the work of the library
should be adopted, and this will be found a very effective method.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec49">49. Accounts.</h4>

<p><b>49. Accounts.</b>&mdash;By the principal English Act, Section 20 (1),
it is ordained that &#8220;separate accounts shall be kept of the receipts
and expenditure under this Act of every library authority and
its officers, and those accounts shall be audited in like manner
and with the like incidents and consequences, in the case of a
library authority being an urban authority, and of its officers,
as the accounts of the receipts and expenditure of that authority
and its officers under the Public Health Acts.&#8221; In Ireland the
same provisions apply, that is, library accounts are to be kept
and audited like those of the local authority, and copies of the
accounts are to be sent within one month after auditing to the
Lord Lieutenant. In Scotland the accounts are to be kept
separately in special books, and are to be audited by &#8220;one or
more competent auditors.&#8221; In all cases the books are to be open
to public inspection, and in Scotland abstracts of the accounts
are to be inserted in one or more newspapers published or circulated
in the district.</p>

<p>No special system of library book-keeping has been laid down,
the nearest approach to a form being that prescribed by an order
of the Local Government Board, dated 26th November 1892,
for parishes whose library accounts are audited in like manner
to those of Poor Law Guardians. In Greenwood&#8217;s <i>Public
Libraries</i>, fourth edition, 1894, pages 343-345, some details are
given of this system, and the first edition of this <i>Manual</i> also
gives specimens of forms, etc.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec50">50. Financial Statement.</h4>

<p><b>50. Financial Statement.</b>&mdash;The form of financial statement
for public libraries in parishes, prescribed by the Local Government
Board, alluded to in <a href="#Sec49">Section 49</a>, is the best for all purposes.
As shown in the section on <a href="#Sec29">Annual Estimates</a>, it provides for
every kind of receipt and expenditure. Printed blanks giving
the whole of the items copied from the L.G.B. Order of 1892
have been published. In addition to a blank tabular form for
showing particulars of loans, etc., the statement includes spaces
for the undernoted items, all duly set out to form a balance

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec51">51. Audit.</h4>

<p><b>51. Audit.</b>&mdash;In cases where library accounts are audited under
the &#8220;District Auditors&#8217; Act, 1879,&#8221; it is imperative that all the
forms and consequences should be borne in mind. District
auditors have power to surcharge expenditures for items which
in their opinion cannot be legally incurred under the provisions
of the Public Libraries Acts, and it should also be remembered
that the committee-men who sign the disputed cheque are held
liable. The powers vested in library authorities are so wide
that it is very doubtful if some district auditors are not exceeding
their authority by objecting, as they have done in some places,
to payments for publications, subscriptions to societies, expenses
of lectures, and other items. In cases of surcharge
appeal for relief should be made to the Local Government
Board, when it is a first offence, or when there is good grounds
for challenging the decision of the auditor. The cost of
auditing accounts is laid down in the &#8220;District Auditors&#8217;
Act, 1879,&#8221; according to the following scale. The library
authority is required to purchase the necessary stamps to
cover the amount:</p>

<h3>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="title">THE MATERIAL OF THE ANNUAL REPORT. STATISTICS, WORKING
RECORDS. FORM OF THE ANNUAL REPORT</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec55">55. Statistical Methods.</h4>

<p><b>55. Statistical Methods.</b>&mdash;It seems desirable to describe here,
as being concerned with committee work, the various statistical
and other methods adopted to show the operations of the library.
Every business concern of any consequence has what approximates
to a statistical department, in which records are kept and
analysed of every transaction of the business, and from these
useful deductions are made. Such statistics, with the necessary
proviso that the keeping of them should not impede more
obvious work, are desirable for libraries, and although they are
necessarily of a quantitative rather than qualitative character,
they are nevertheless of value as showing the use made of the
several departments and of the various classes of the stock.
Statistics usually kept include: the stock; accessions; the issue
of books and material in each department according to their
classes; the number of readers&#8217; tickets in force; and the
attendances at the reading rooms. Sometimes records are kept
of the occupations and ages of readers, and the wards from
which they are drawn.</p>

<p>Hitherto all these statistics have been of doubtful comparative
value, owing to the great divergence in the methods of computation
adopted, and the methods of administering the library
have a definite effect upon the resultant figures. For example,
in the few libraries where so brief a time as a week is allowed
for the reading of a volume, the issue figures will be higher than
in those where a fortnight or more is allowed. Then, the amounts
charged as fines for undue detention of books, ranging from 1d.
a week or part of a week to 1d. a day beyond the time allowed,
make a difference of some moment. Again, in some libraries it
is usual to record the number of borrowers continuously, only
counting off the lapsed tickets, while in others only those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
borrowers who are actually using the libraries within the year
are counted. It would be well if an effort were made to
standardize all these methods. A scheme for standardizing
the form in which they are to be presented has been reached,
and is described below (<a href="#Sec62">Section 62</a>).</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec56">56.</h4>

<p><b>56.</b> A satisfactory record of the relative circulation of books
can be made only of a classified stock. Certainly comparisons
cannot be fairly made while one librarian classes his periodicals
as science, useful arts, etc., and another groups his together as
miscellaneous. Then, some librarians, rightly we think, separate
Juvenile Fiction issues from Adult Fiction issues; and, indeed,
divergences and anomalies are frequent and are confusing.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig4">Suggested rulings</a> for Issue Record books, for lending and
reference libraries respectively, are given on <a href="#Page_62">page 62</a>.</p>

<p>The record book should have about thirty-five lines to the
page, exclusive of the headings, to allow one line for each day
and leave room for adding up the columns. The dates, 1 to 31,
may be printed down each column, but this will mean leaving
gaps for Sundays. It is better to write the dates in for each
month, omitting Sundays, which may be entered on a separate
page or pages. The issues of each year should be kept together
in a series; and a page or more, as required, should be left for
the necessary summaries, which can be entered up to show the
total issues month by month in cumulative form. If this is done
regularly the figures for the annual or other reports are quite
easily obtained. The accessions book, if kept entered, added and
classified up to date, will give similar information about books.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec57">57.</h4>

<p><b>57.</b> It is usual to count volumes separately. Thus a work in
five volumes is counted as 5 in the record. Illustrations,
pamphlets, broadsides and other material in separate form are
usually counted in the same way, but are sometimes indicated
as being of this separate character in separate columns. There
are minor problems in counting which interest librarians, and
upon which opinion is divided. Thus, when a series of prints
are formed into a public exhibition, it is sometimes the practice
to count each print as having been issued once. They may,
however, have been examined by hundreds of people during
the exhibition, and sometimes an allowance is made for that
fact. Again, the consultation of a magazine in the reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
rooms is usually not counted; but the same magazine when
bound is counted if issued from the shelves in the reference library.
Directories, time-tables, and similar quick-reference works are
often omitted from the statistics. There seems no reason why
all these uses of material should not be recorded, so long as the
character of the use is made clear in the reports of the librarian.
Otherwise the frequent complaint of librarians that their figures
represent only part of their work seems to be justified; and it
is well to remember that public criticism of libraries is in the
main based upon their statistics. At the same time if the
recording of statistics means the placing of barriers between
books and readers, it is a safe principle to prefer fewer statistics
and more accessibility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p class="blankbefore">The record of the number of readers should be confined to
those whose tickets are &#8220;live&#8221; ones. This does not mean
necessarily that tickets not in active use at the time statistics
are compiled should be regarded as &#8220;dead.&#8221; A borrower may
leave his ticket in abeyance for several months with the intention
of using it later. It does mean that only those tickets
should be counted which are valid at the time. As we have seen,
validity ranges from one to three or more years in different
libraries, and the figures as a rule will be only approximately
sound. If, however, all valid tickets are included, and if the
number of tickets issued within the year covered by the annual
report is also indicated, the record will be a serviceable account
of the use made in relation to the population of the district served.
It is usual to show the number of actual borrowers divided into
burgesses and non-burgesses; of non-resident borrowers (employees,
scholars, etc.); and of supplementary tickets (non-fiction,
teachers&#8217;, illustration, music, etc.) held by them.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec58">58.</h4>

<p><b>58.</b> Where it is thought necessary to keep records of the
occupations of readers, a blank line for the name of the occupation
is included on the application voucher (see <a href="#Sec368">Section 368</a>) from
which the records are made.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec59">59.</h4>

<p><b>59.</b> It is not usual to keep formal statistics of the number of
visitors to newspaper and periodical rooms; the attendances
are either not recorded or are estimated. In some cases, however,
a daily count is made at monthly or other intervals and
the yearly attendance is gauged from this. It is obvious that
such figures have no great value. A series of visits to the rooms
will assure any librarian or member of committee of the amount
of use that is made of them equally well.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec60">60.</h4>

<p><b>60.</b> Brief paragraphs, presenting the record of work weekly
or monthly, and the number of borrowers, are sometimes sent
to the local newspapers. This is a good plan, and the matter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
is more acceptable if presented in literary rather than in merely
tabular form. At each meeting of the library committee a fairly
complete statistical record of the work since the last meeting
is presented, in which the factors we have discussed, together
with the percentage of fiction issued, and comparisons with the
corresponding weeks or months of the previous year, are made.
The committee is thus kept closely acquainted with the results
of its work.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec61">61. The Annual Report.</h4>

<p><b>61. The Annual Report.</b>&mdash;The annual report of the library
committee is the summary and crown of its labours, and is
often the most direct means of contact between the committee
and the community. Such reports deserve more attention than
is commonly given to them by librarians, and in this matter
the American librarian&mdash;who is essentially a business man and
does not often produce useless documents&mdash;may give hints to
his British brethren. A report should be a complete history of
the operations of the library in all its departments; and if
improvement is necessary it is in the direction of reducing the
mere statistical and in increasing the literary matter to be
included. Elaborate tables of issue, stock, etc., of central and
branch libraries have a use for the librarian and may be kept
at the libraries, but their publication is of interest to few other
people, and they are better given in summary. Plain and clear
reports, in which comparisons with other libraries by name
should be avoided, and which present the salient statistics
without the use of confusingly elaborate tables, give the best
results. Illustrations and an occasional diagram rendering in
graphic form the statistical results of work are not necessarily
superfluous, and may brighten the report considerably. The
report will not be a less authoritative document if it is attractive.
The information which a library report ought to convey may be
indicated briefly as follows:</p>

<p class="fsize80 blankbefore">Title-page.</p>

<p class="fsize80">List of members of committee and library staff.</p>

<p class="fsize80">Narrative report.</p>

<p class="fsize80">[This is the most interesting feature from the public point of view. It
is usually a review of the year founded upon the statistics, etc., in the
appendix, and is properly presented as if written by the committee and
signed by the chairman. Frequently, however, it takes the form of a
report written by the librarian to the committee, to be adopted as
the<span class="pagenumlg"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
committee&#8217;s report. Each method has advantages. The committee
can appeal to the council upon any part of its policy with greater authority
than the librarian. On the other hand, the librarian can express views
of the work and needs of the library from his own standpoint. The character
of the document, however, would seem to require that a report
should be the committee&#8217;s. Sometimes, as usually in America, the
question is solved by having a brief report from the committee, followed
by a longer one from the librarian.]</p>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>62. Library Association Summary.</b>&mdash;The appendix outlined
above may be reduced considerably by substituting for most of
the items a summary in the form recommended by the Library
Association. The financial statement, however, should always
be given in full, even by libraries the accounts of which are kept
by the municipal treasurer or accountant. It is clearly impossible
to gauge the character of any library&#8217;s work if the distribution
of expenditure in performing it is not shown. The summary
recommended by the Library Association resembles a summary
used in American library reports, and is the outcome of a suggestion
made to a meeting of the North Central Library Association
in 1916 by Mr E. L. Hetherington, then Secretary of the

present the statistics of libraries in a succinct and simple manner,
but by its general adoption to secure a uniform record from all
libraries by which satisfactory comparisons may be made. No
library report should appear without this summary, even if the
librarian chooses to retain his more elaborate tables; and, in
view of its utility and the proposed generalness of its use, we
append it in full with the Library Association&#8217;s explanatory

<p class="hind2_4 fsize80 blankbefore"><i>Volumes</i> mean books as they stand on the shelves.</p>

<p class="hind2_4 fsize80"><i>Pieces</i> mean separate works or parts (each usually having a separate

the like).</p>

<p class="hind2_4 fsize80"><i>Papers</i> mean lesser items, usually with less than 5 pages, as broadsides,
cards, fly-sheets.</p>

<p class="hind2_4 fsize80"><i>Items</i> mean volumes, pieces and papers.</p>

<p class="hind2_4 fsize80"><i>Works</i> mean whole literary productions whether in several volumes
or only one piece.</p>

<p class="hind2_4 fsize80">Thus: Ten pamphlets bound together, with five broadsides at end,
are one volume, ten works or pieces, fifteen items. A dictionary
in twenty volumes would count as twenty volumes, pieces and
items, but one work, and in a sense one book.</p>

<p class="fsize80 blankbefore">Having regard to these definitions care should be taken, in recording

<h2>DIVISION III<br />
STAFF</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="title">THE LIBRARIAN</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec65">65. General.</h4>

<p><b>65. General.</b>&mdash;The success or failure of a library depends
almost entirely upon the ability and energy of the staff. Opinion
upon this question has been almost revolutionized in the past
twenty years, and only very occasionally now do we find some
misguided library authority placing so special an institution
in the keeping of stickit ministers, unlucky schoolmasters, retired
soldiers, minor journalists, unsuccessful booksellers, and similar
remnants of the failures or superannuated in other walks of life.
No untrained person is likely to attain more than the poorest
or most commonplace results and will undoubtedly prevent the
library from serving the community to anything like its potential
capacity. Indeed, the work of the librarian is a professional
occupation demanding for its successful accomplishment a training
as complete and special at least as that required of the teacher.
A committee fails signally in its public duty if it does not recognize
this fact in the choice of its librarian; and the public has a
right to demand that the man appointed to occupy any technical
public office shall have had both training and experience.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec66">66.</h4>

<p><b>66.</b> The appointment of a chief librarian should be the first
step taken by a committee. Numberless blunders, often resulting
in great subsequent expense, have been made in the past
through the mistaken economy of proceeding with buildings,
methods and book-selection before such appointment. These
matters are essentially the work of the librarian and <i>not</i> of the
committee; and any little amount that may be saved from the
salary of the librarian is invariably lost because of the adoption
of faulty apparatus or plans; amateur experiments are usually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
expensive. If, at the beginning of its career, a library committee
is unable to engage a qualified librarian, application
should be made to the Library Association for the nomination
of a professional adviser, who for a reasonable fee would give
invaluable assistance at the time when such assistance is really
vital.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec67">67. Qualifications.</h4>

<p><b>67. Qualifications.</b>&mdash;As is the case with the prominent members
of every other profession, good librarians are born, not made.
Training and experience cannot create such natural endowments
as enthusiasm, originality, initiative&mdash;in short, positive genius
for the work; but training and experience in sound methods
will provide a passable substitute. Experience, however,
depends for its value upon its character, and long years in inefficiently-managed
libraries will not suffice for modern needs.
Owing to the wide difference between the methods of, say, thirty
years ago, and the more scientific methods of to-day, it is necessary
to judge the experience of any librarian by the school in
which he has been trained. This does not mean that a library
which has been in existence thirty years or more is operated by
obsolete methods; most of the larger libraries, indeed, have
kept pace with, and have helped to originate, the modern methods
which are to be preferred. At the same time the practice of
appointing librarians from larger libraries in preference to those
from smaller ones is often mistaken. A small library may afford
its staff opportunities for a more comprehensive training than a
large one, but it may not be so extensive in detail. In short,
the <i>size</i> of the library in which a man is trained is no index to
the character of its service, and this character is the main factor
in considering experience.</p>

<p>The physical qualifications of a librarian should include good
health, freedom from deformity, defect or incurable disease, and
his or her age should not usually be less than twenty-five. Age
is not so important in cases of promotion, as the committee has
first-hand and accurate knowledge of capabilities to guide it.
As regards the physical condition of librarians, it may be said
generally that the same principles which guide selection in
business appointments should be the rule in library appointments.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec68">68.</h4>

<p><b>68.</b> The professional attainments of a librarian should be
judged mainly by their suitability for the duties to be performed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
The degree of attainment differs in individuals, and it would
be unfair to expect so many useful qualifications in a librarian
who is to receive &pound;200 per annum as in one who is to receive a
much larger salary. But there are certain broad principles to
be considered, the cardinal one being that <i>only trained librarians
should ever be appointed to chief positions</i>. A committee is safe
in selecting candidates from amongst diplomates, fellows and
members of the Library Association, as these <i>ipso facto</i> have
received the training indicated. We give in <a href="#Sec99">Sections 99</a>-<a href="#Sec101">101</a>
some account of the compass and activities of the Library
Association, and commend what is there written to the consideration
of library committees. Here it may be said that a
diplomate is a librarian who has received at least three years&#8217;
training in a library recognized by the Association, has gained
the six provisional certificates of that body in literary history,
bibliography, classification, cataloguing, library organization
and library routine, and has in addition shown a knowledge of
Latin and one modern foreign language, and has presented an
acceptable written thesis showing independent research upon
some department of librarianship. The diploma is a very considerable
attainment, and is at present held by few librarians,
but the number increases, and no doubt its possession will influence
future appointments considerably. It was initiated in
1901, and therefore too recently to have made it possible for all
eligible candidates for appointments to have acquired it. To
meet this situation, and to set up a standard of qualification, the
Library Association adopted in 1911 a scheme for the classification
of librarians into fellows, members, and student-members.
A fellow is a librarian of approved experience who held office
prior to the end of 1914, a librarian who holds the diploma, or a
university degree plus approved library experience, or an assistant
librarian of proved reputation and capacity who held office
prior to the date named. All other librarians at the initiation
of this scheme were classified as members (except very young
men and women who became student-members and whose degree
of training may be judged from that name). After 1914 admission
to fellowship has generally been restricted to diplomates,
or graduates with library experience, save in exceptional cases
where great and proved capacity has been shown; and admission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
to membership has been restricted to chief librarians, or to
assistants who hold four of the six diploma certificates. Other
factors may apply in individual cases, but there are very few
librarians or assistants of character and ability who are
either members or certificate-holders of the Association.</p>

<p>With due allowance for the size and means of the library,
and the salary to be offered to the librarian, the following list
of qualifications may serve as a guide to a committee as to what
they may expect.</p>

<p class="center blankbefore">LIBRARIAN&#8217;S QUALIFICATIONS</p>

<p class="blankbefore fsize80">1. Training for at least three years in a library which is classified

<p class="fsize80">2. A wide knowledge of English and Foreign Bibliography and
Literature, and an intimate and exact knowledge of the contents of
modern, and especially technical, scientific, and historical, books.</p>

<p class="fsize80">3. Sufficient acquaintance with languages to enable the translating
of title-pages with the aid of dictionaries.</p>

<p class="fsize80">4. A knowledge of business routine, including elementary book-keeping

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec70">70. Salaries.</h4>

<p><b>70. Salaries.</b>&mdash;Owing to the limitation of the library rate
and a general underestimate of the librarian&#8217;s utility, salaries
in municipal libraries are not very liberal, and may be described
as inadequate. In the state, university and some of the endowed
and proprietary libraries the salaries range much higher, taken
all round. These appointments, however, especially such as
the British Museum, India Office, the Houses of Parliament,
the universities and similar institutions, are seldom offered for
competition. In public municipal libraries the salaries of chief
librarians range downward from about &pound;800. Some of the large
London proprietary libraries, and many of the provincial libraries
of a similar kind, give salaries to about the same maximum.</p>

<p>A careful analysis of the income, population and work of the
principal English and American libraries has enabled the
following <a href="#Fig5">table</a> to be produced, showing the amount which
a library can reasonably pay for a good officer. This scale is
considerably below the American one, but slightly higher than
the English.</p>

<p class="fsize80">[The above table is rather higher than that given in the last edition, as
regards the libraries with incomes exceeding &pound;3000, and is based upon my
own inquiries and conclusions as they have been affected by the European
War. Few librarians receive normally &pound;1000, and it is quite clear that
the present salaries for the greater libraries are most inadequate, having
regard to the responsibilities involved.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Editor.</span>]</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec71">71.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>71.</b> The only other point of importance arising out of the
question of librarians&#8217; salaries is that of providing a residence on
the library premises. This policy has been adopted in London
more than anywhere else. It affects the question of salary to
some extent, though not quite so much as has been claimed.
A committee of a &pound;4000 library might argue that, by providing
a good house in a valuable position, they are only entitled to
give a salary of &pound;325, the balance of &pound;100 being represented
by the house. The practical reply to this is, that a house under
these conditions, although it could rent at &pound;100 or even more,
is just worth to the librarian exactly what he would be prepared
to pay for house rent if he lived away from the library. Any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
allowance or deduction should accordingly be based upon this
consideration. In small libraries it is not advisable to incur
additional cost in the erection of buildings by providing a residence
for the librarian in order to save on his salary. Beyond the
advantage of having a librarian living on the premises as a kind
of superior perpetual caretaker, there is little to be gained by
complicating a library building with such an excrescence as a
residence. If houses are provided at all, they should be mainly
used by caretakers who have to get up early, and there is a
decided convenience in having an officer of this description
always at hand. If possible, residences should be erected as
far away from public reading-rooms as they can be, the occupation
of rooms over news-rooms, etc., having been proved to
be unhealthy in many cases. The accommodation provided
for a caretaker usually consists of a sitting-room or large kitchen,
parlour, two bedrooms, and the usual offices. In some London
libraries very liberal provision has been made for librarians living
on the premises, the accommodation consisting of three large
living rooms, four or five bedrooms, kitchen, scullery, bathroom
and other offices. The whole question of residence or non-residence
is one for library authorities to decide for themselves,
but the matter is another proof of the necessity which exists
for appointing librarians before buildings are erected.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec72">72. Superannuation.</h4>

<p><b>72. Superannuation.</b>&mdash;There is no general law at present
under which public librarians can retire on a pension after a
certain age has been reached. Some towns have made separate
arrangements for the superannuation of all their officers, but
even this is far from common. The National Association of
Local Government Officers, which deserves the support of
librarians and committees, has a Bill before Parliament, the
object of which is to procure for municipal officers the same
regulations as to superannuation as are in force for poor-law
officers, but this has not yet passed into law.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec73">73. Conditions of Librarian&#8217;s Appointment.</h4>

<p><b>73. Conditions of Librarian&#8217;s Appointment.</b>&mdash;There are several
points requiring notice in connexion with the conditions
upon which librarians are appointed. It is not usual to draw
up a formal agreement, but if this is done it should be executed
by a solicitor, and specify the principal obligations, terms and
duration of the appointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80 blankbefore">1. In large libraries it is usual to stipulate that the librarian must devote
the whole of his or her <span class="smcapall">TIME</span> to the duties of the office. This simply
means that no other office can be held concurrently, but particularly
a paid office. A librarian&#8217;s private time can be devoted to any hobby
he chooses, be it gardening, cycling, photography, literature, music or
sport. Provided, always, such recreations do not render a librarian
less fit for his public duty. Official time occupied in any work which
has for its object improvement in professional knowledge should be
allowed within reasonable limits. Attendances at meetings called for
professional purposes, or visits to other places for the purpose of acquiring
professional knowledge, would, we take it, be considered quite legitimate.
Where a certain number of hours daily or weekly has been
fixed, the question of the disposal of a librarian&#8217;s leisure time will
not arise.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">2. Notice of intention to <span class="smcapall">DETERMINE AN APPOINTMENT</span> might be stipulated
for in an agreement. The usual practice is one month&#8217;s notice on
either side.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">3. A public librarian who handles public money should be required to
obtain security from a recognized guarantee office. The amount
insured against will generally be fully covered by a sum equal to 10
per cent. of the annual income of the library. Thus, a library with an
income of &pound;2000 should make &pound;200 the insurable sum, as this will
cover any possible defalcations of the librarians, who, under any circumstances,
in such a library, can never handle more than about &pound;60
or &pound;70 in the course of one month. The premium for municipal
officers averages about 5s. per cent., and, of course, the library
authority should make the annual payments to keep the policy alive.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80" id="Ref46">4. The <span class="smcapall">VACATION</span>
allowed to librarians varies with the conditions of each
place. In some cases five weeks are allowed, irrespective of the time
occupied by conferences or other annual meetings. Usually four
weeks are given. As a rule, committees will not be found niggardly
in this matter when they have an officer whom they can respect and
trust. In American libraries a month is often allowed, and in some
cases much longer periods.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80" id="Ref36">5. The only <span class="smcapall">ANNUAL CONFERENCES</span> of any importance in connexion with
public library work are those of the Library Association and the
Museums Association. Practice differs as regards libraries sending
delegates to the annual conferences of the Library Association. In
some cases where a library is a subscribing member, and, in addition,
the librarian is also a member in his own name, it sends a member of
the committee and the librarian, and pays their expenses. In other
cases the librarian alone is sent, and his expenses paid. In still other
cases the librarian is allowed the time to attend, but has to pay his
own expenses; while, sometimes, the chairman of committee attends,
and either pays his own expenses or has them paid by the committee.</p>

<p class="hind4_2 fsize80">Every library which desires to keep abreast with modern ideas in
library work should send its librarian to the annual conferences of the
Library Association, and pay his expenses. All public libraries
should<span class="pagenumlg"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
join this association as institution members, and their librarian will
naturally be a member in his own right. There is more knowledge
and good obtained by a librarian coming into personal touch with other
librarians during a conference week than can ever be achieved in a
state of hermit-like seclusion. The sum spent on a library conference
to insure a librarian&#8217;s attendance is by far the most profitable investment
a library committee can make in a single year.</p>

<p class="hind4_2 fsize80">Some doubt exists as to whether members of committee can be sent
at the expense of the library rate, and, so far as parishes are concerned,
it has been decided by the district auditors that they can not be sent
unless at their own personal expense. Municipal boroughs have power
to send committee delegates if so disposed, but the matter remains
doubtful as regards Urban District Councils.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec74">74. Duties of the Librarian.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>74. Duties of the Librarian.</b>&mdash;The duties of a librarian practically
cover every section of this <i>Manual</i>, and it is therefore
needless to go over the same ground here. It may be assumed,
however, that the librarian also acts as clerk to his committee,
and a few of the more personal duties of the librarian may be
specified. It has been recommended that a librarian should act
as clerk, and some reasons may be given why this course should
always be taken. The librarian is the only official who holds
all the threads of work and routine in his hands or who thoroughly
understands the practical working of the institution. By combining
the functions he remains in touch with his committee,
and can much better understand their views than if a second
person acts as intermediary or interpreter. The plan is also more
economical, as town clerks sometimes take a salary for acting as
clerk to the library committee, or charge a proportion of office
expenses to the library. Both courses are quite unnecessary.
It is not desirable, when a library committee has obtained a
complete or partial delegation of powers, to have its work controlled
or interfered with by another municipal department.
Even when a library committee remains but an ordinary committee
of a local authority, it is not desirable for the town clerk
to do more than depute a junior clerk to attend meetings for the
sole purpose of recording minutes. The chairman and librarian
should call all meetings and arrange all necessary business. It
is too often overlooked that library committees are appointed
to carry out special work under a special Act of Parliament, and
that, in consequence, they are performing duties outside the
ordinary routine of municipal work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec75">75.</h4>

<p><b>75.</b> The following summary of the more important duties of
the librarian is applicable to the average library, but must be
adjusted considerably in large libraries, where the chief librarian
is mainly an administrator. Such large libraries have special
departmental experts, and it is clear that over many of these
items the chief librarian can exercise only a general supervision.
Where there are large trained staffs he should avoid details and
concern himself with the general direction of all departments;
otherwise he will become immersed impossibly in minuti&aelig; to
the great detriment of the library service as a whole:</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80 blankbefore">1. He must superintend and prepare all the business for the library committee,
including summoning meetings, preparing agendas, checking
accounts, compiling lists of books, preparing reports and taking
minutes of proceedings.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">2. He must attend all committee meetings, and such of the local authority
meetings as may be fixed.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">3. He must prepare all specifications for contracts, and bring forward
in plenty of time all business which arises regularly, either monthly,
quarterly or annually.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">4. He should sign all orders and be responsible for all correspondence connected
with the library. He should keep copies of all orders and
important letters, as well as copies of any specifications or other
documents.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">5. He must fix the time, duties and daily work of the staff, and superintend
and check their attendance and work in every department.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">6. He must see that order is maintained among readers throughout the
main building and branches, and that the rules are enforced within
reason, and that the opening and closing of the library are done
punctually.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">7. He must carefully supervise the selection of books and periodicals for
addition to the library, and examine all necessary lists, catalogues and
reviews for that purpose.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">8. He should check all cataloguing and classification work.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">9. He should be prepared when called upon to aid readers, as far as possible,
in any line of research, and should be easily accessible at all times when
on duty.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="title">ASSISTANTS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec78">78. General.</h4>

<p><b>78. General.</b>&mdash;The organization of the library staff under the
chief librarian is naturally governed by the number of assistants
and the size of the system they work. Most libraries have
a second qualified librarian who is variously called Deputy-Librarian
or Sub-Librarian [or sometimes he is called Chief
Assistant Librarian, Deputy Chief Librarian, or, more rarely in
England, Vice-Librarian. There is still considerable confusion
in the nomenclature of library offices, and it would be well
if a uniform system were adopted. (See <a href="#AppI">Appendix I.</a>)]. Large
libraries have, in addition, a hierarchy of assistants, as
follows: 1. A Superintendent of Branches, where there are
several libraries in the system, as at Birmingham, Glasgow, etc.;
2. Librarians-in-Charge of the several departments; 3. Branch
Librarians; 4. Senior assistants; 5. Junior assistants. The
qualifications of Deputy, Superintendent of Branches, Librarians-in-Charge
and Branch Librarians differ from those of the Chief
Librarian in degree rather than in kind, and to these positions
only trained men should be appointed. In many cases they are
appointed from staff, not always to the benefit of the library.
It is a sound plan to throw open all the higher appointments in
libraries to competition, in which competition, of course, any
member of the existing staff should be allowed, without prejudice,
to compete. One of the mistaken policies, especially of
large libraries, has been to promote men because of mere length
of service. Such service is undoubtedly valuable, but is not
necessarily a proof of qualification for higher library positions.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec79">79. Deputy-Librarian.</h4>

<p><b>79. Deputy-Librarian.</b>&mdash;It may be affirmed that appointments
to any senior position should be subject to the same principles,
and to conditions similar to those governing the appointment
of chief librarians. In small libraries the means at the disposal
of the committee do not always permit of a salary sufficient to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
attract a diplomate of the Library Association, or a man similarly
qualified, but no assistant who is inexperienced or is without the
certificates of the Library Association should ever be appointed
to the important position of Deputy-Librarian. The duties of
the Deputy-Librarian comprise the whole administration of the
library system under the chief librarian, the general supervision
of every department, and the direction of the duties of the whole
staff. He becomes acting-chief librarian in every absence of
his principal, and should be qualified to assume this position
both by his knowledge and his personality. It is therefore clear
that his technical training must in general be as sound and
catholic as that of his chief; and in addition to this quality, he
should possess initiative, disciplinary powers, discretion, and
loyalty to his chief and to the existing system. In detail his
duties will vary according to the size of the system; and in
small libraries he will be merely the superior assistant, taking
part in every operation (except the merely mechanical ones,
which may be performed by untrained juniors) of the library;
in somewhat larger libraries he may arrange the hours and duties
of the staff and superintend them, and check all cataloguing and
classification. In the largest libraries his work is almost purely
administrative.</p>

<p>The conditions of the appointment of a Deputy-Librarian are
somewhat difficult to describe, owing to the divergences we have
named. He usually, but not always, works similar hours to the
remainder of the staff; has his own office, or, at any rate, private
desk; and is usually invested with considerable authority. It
should be the aim of the chief librarian to make this office a
worthy one&mdash;and to see that only worthy persons occupy it.
A good deputy gives tone to the whole staff, as he comes into
more intimate contact with it than the chief librarian. The
salaries paid to Deputy-Librarians are again matters which vary;
they range from &pound;100 to &pound;300, and in a few places to much
higher sums than this. [In the last edition it was laid down that
the deputy should receive a maximum of not less than half of
that of the chief; but we think any dogmatic statement of that
kind objectionable, as being subject to numberless variations in
various places.]</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec80">80. Superintendent of Branches.</h4>

<p><b>80. Superintendent of Branches.</b>&mdash;This librarian acts as
a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
<i>liaison</i> officer between the chief librarian and the branch librarian
in systems where there are many branch libraries. He must be
qualified to assess the work of each library and to co-ordinate
the whole branch system, to look over time-sheets, examine into
the performance of the assistants, judge their capacity and
training, advise as to the books required in particular localities,
and, in general, make the units of the system smooth-working
parts of a homogenous whole. It is probable that a capable
superintendent is an economy of some consequence in a large
system. Few libraries, however, with less than a dozen
branches possess such an officer, his duties usually in other
cases falling upon the chief or deputy librarians. The superintendent
is subordinate to the deputy-librarian, and his salary
is something more than that of a branch or departmental
librarian.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec81">81. Departmental Librarians.</h4>

<p><b>81. Departmental Librarians.</b>&mdash;Of recent years the tendency
in library work has been towards specialization, and in most
libraries of any size assistants are given more or less permanent
charge of departments, and are usually called librarians-in-charge.
The librarian of a branch library falls into this category
although he may not occupy exactly the same level on the staff
as the librarian-in-charge of the reference library; as, also, in
libraries which have such departments, does the head of the
cataloguing staff, the order division, etc. In the great libraries
the librarian-in-charge of the reference department is easily the
head of the grade we are discussing, as he must obviously be a
person of considerable bibliographical acquirements in addition
to being the possessor of a complete library training, and his
work lies with inquirers, research workers, and similar readers
who require skilled and sympathetic assistance. In the majority
of libraries all librarians-in-charge are regarded as official equals.
Their salaries are obviously governed by the wealth and work
of the library concerned, but a rough calculation ranges them
at from the inadequate minimum of &pound;90 to about &pound;250 or more,
with many intermediate scales. The duties of a librarian-in-charge
involve the responsibility of conducting the department
according to the prevailing library policy, the arranging of the
duties of the staff and the seeing that they are performed, the
training of the staff, the maintenance of order in public rooms,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
and the exploiting of the department to the utmost in the interest
of the public.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec82">82. Library Councils.</h4>

<p><b>82. Library Councils.</b>&mdash;In some libraries the chief librarians
have formed the deputy-librarian, the superintendent of branches
and the librarians-in-charge into a committee which is variously
named, but is commonly called by the large name of the Library
Council, which meets weekly or monthly in the chief librarian&#8217;s
office and discusses the current methods of the library system
and the means whereby its activities may be improved and its
influence extended. Such a council has necessarily only a
consultative function, and all decisions it reaches are subject to
the chief librarian. Regular agenda are often used and minutes
kept of such meetings, and they are surprisingly fruitful in useful
and practical suggestions. Even quite impractical suggestions
should be encouraged at such meetings, as they often throw
light on the general work and lead to other suggestions of a useful
character. More and more both in this country and in
America the chief librarians are taking their senior colleagues
into their confidence in this way, and thus a community of
interest is created and an enthusiasm is fostered which are well
worth having.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec83">83. Assistants.</h4>

<p><b>83. Assistants.</b>&mdash;In America the library assistant is in the
best instances a person who is a graduate of a college or who has
had a high school education; who, in addition, has taken a course
of one year, or, in special instances, two years at a library school.
Not all or even the majority of assistants are of this type, as the
American library is unable to afford a large number of workers
so highly qualified. On this side of the Atlantic the American
system is an impossible ideal in existing circumstances; not one
library in the kingdom&mdash;except, occasionally, the Government
libraries&mdash;could pay the initial salaries which such training
should command. Indeed, the whole question of staffing libraries
is affected in most adverse manner by the inadequacy of library
incomes. Assistants must as a rule be chosen from amongst
young people just leaving school&mdash;often Council elementary or
secondary schools. They are therefore people in almost every
sense, except, it may be, natural ability, incapable at the beginning
of their library career of anything more than the mere
mechanical tasks. They have to be educated before they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
trained technically in most cases. To secure the right material
it is becoming the practice to demand of candidates for library
work a fair general knowledge, and the Library Association has
asked that some such certificate as matriculation, or the Oxford
and Cambridge Locals, should be required of them. Where the
supply of candidates so qualified does not exist, the chief librarian
sets a simple qualifying examination paper to test the common
sense and education of candidates. Appointments are usually
made for a probationary period of about three months, at the
end of which time it is possible to judge in a rough way whether
the youngster will benefit by library training or not. Owing to
the limited prospects the work offers the librarian has a moral
obligation to see that appointees who are unsuitable are encouraged
to seek other occupations as soon as their unfitness
for librarianship is proven. Where both sexes are employed
exactly the same type of qualifications should be required from
each, and equal remuneration should be paid. The smaller
salaries sometimes offered to girls have ill results both upon the
individual candidates and upon the library.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec84">84. Hours.</h4>

<p><b>84. Hours.</b>&mdash;The last exhaustive inquiry into the hours
worked by municipal library assistants was made by the Library
Assistants&#8217; Association in 1911, who embodied its results in a
valuable report. Hours are naturally influenced by the prevailing
length of working-time in commerce and in other walks of
life. The average number worked in libraries in 1908 was 48
weekly; in 1911 it was 45&middot;22; but the tendency is to make it
42 hours. The difficulties which face a librarian in arranging
a time-sheet are that he has usually too small a staff, and cannot
afford a larger one, and that the library is in many or all of
its departments open from twelve to fourteen hours daily. This
involves evening work on several days in the week, and means
that the hours are irregular and broken. At the same time the
nature of library work is exacting, and much more efficient work
can be expected from a seven-hours&#8217;, or even shorter, day than
from a longer one. Study, recreation and social experience are
absolutely necessary for successful work; and time-sheets
should be arranged to make these possible. There is no excuse
whatever for the at one time prevailing time-sheets which
required assistants to work from about 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
an interval of 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> hours for dinner and a similar interval for tea.
The librarian whose staff is so small that these hours are necessary
to keep the library open is attempting at the expense of the
health and whole natural life of his staff to do more work than
the community has a right to expect. Even with the seven-hour
day the broken hours involved form the least attractive
feature of library work. The <a href="#Fig6">time-sheet</a> suggested by the
Library Assistants&#8217; Association is given as a practical solution
of some of the difficulties we have enumerated&mdash;not as an ideal
but as the result of experience. It provides for a half-holiday
weekly and for hours of recreation and study. It should be the
aim to make the use of the sheet regular, so that every assistant
may know what evenings, for example, he has at his disposal
throughout the year. Modifications are sometimes made during
the summer months, when the work is slacker, in the direction of
giving the assistants more free time.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 6</span> (<a href="#Sec84">Section 84</a>).</p>

<p class="fsize80 blankbefore">Hours of duty 42 per week. Each assistant has a half-day
and an evening off, works one night until 10 o&#8217;clock, and comes on one morning at 8.45. The
library is assumed to be open all the week, and where an early-closing day is in vogue,
the time-sheet is simplified by confining nearly all the half-holidays to that day.</p>

<p class="fsize80">The time-sheet would be much improved if 5 p.m. were substituted for
6 p.m. on the evening off; an assistant leaving at 6, after he has had a meal, has very little
evening left. It should be the endeavour so to adjust the sheet that each assistant is off
every other evening, the half-day counting as one. Local circumstances will
suggest variations, which can easily be made.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec85">85.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>85.</b> The whole staff question, so far as junior assistants are
concerned, may be modified by the Education Act of 1918.
This has raised the age at which children may leave school, and
requires of them part-study until the age of 18. Seeing that the
juniors at present engaged are of 14 years and upwards, this may
mean duplicate junior staffs, with accompanying problems of
remuneration. It may be that specialized library training may
be accepted in lieu of the continuation classes contemplated by
the Act. But the matter is at present in a state of transition,
and we can only indicate the new problem.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec86">86. Sunday Work.</h4>

<p><b>86. Sunday Work.</b>&mdash;Some libraries remain open on Sundays
and on public holidays, usually for a part of the day. About
half of these pay extra remuneration for hours worked on these
days; others allow time off through the week for it; and in one
or two places Hebrew assistants are specially employed for
Sunday duty.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec87">87. Junior Assistant.</h4>

<p><b>87. Junior Assistant.</b>&mdash;The work of the assistant in his first
library years is largely mechanical: the preparing of books for
circulating; labelling, card-writing, tagging; keeping shelves in
order and replacing returned books; charging and issue-desk
work of the simpler kind. There is much work in every library
of this unskilled character which forms a useful training in
business habits, order, regularity, etc. It is unfortunate, however,
that the smallness of staffs often makes it necessary to put
the work of issuing books to readers in the hands of juniors.
The actual charging of books is indeed a mechanical process, but
its performance is carried out at one of the main points of contact
with the public where knowledge and experience are of
great value. Larger libraries have, as a rule, departmental staffs
which are confined to the work of the particular department to
which they are accredited. This is undoubtedly the most business-like
and economical method; but every assistant should be
given the opportunity of learning the work of every department
and should be required to do so. This may be done by transferring
the assistants at not too lengthy intervals. In smaller
libraries this departmental division does not exist, and an
assistant may work in the lending library in the morning, in
the reference library in the evening, and at a branch to-morrow,
just as the exigencies of the service dictate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89-<br />90]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a></span></p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec88">88. Senior Assistant.</h4>

<p><b>88. Senior Assistant.</b>&mdash;The name senior assistant is bestowed
upon assistants with a few years&#8217; experience and training, including
as a rule the possession of two or more certificates of
the Library Association. They occupy a position somewhat
analogous to that of non-commissioned officers, and act as reliefs
to the librarians-in-charge. Often they are made responsible
for some branch of the routine, as, for example, book-binding,
defaulters, registration of borrowers, etc., and this is a good
method, provided that any one assistant is not confined rigidly
and for too long to one task. A sense of responsibility is a
useful quality which can be fostered in this way. Usually
senior assistants are promoted from the junior staff, but not
always; and it is becoming a general condition of promotion
to this grade that the candidate shall have taken some
part of the Library Association course. Promotion should
never be made unless the candidate has shown a disposition to
qualify in some such manner.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec89">89. Work Book.</h4>

<p><b>89. Work Book.</b>&mdash;It is a good plan to use a work book or
duty book, in which the daily duties of each assistant can be
entered. By means of such a book it is easy to change the
work about, in order to give every assistant an opportunity of
doing everything in turn; and it is necessary because of the
changes worked on the composition of the staff by the time-sheet.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
A good form of work book for a library where the staff
is not departmental is shown in the ruling <a href="#Fig7">below</a>, which can be
adjusted to meet the conditions in large libraries. The names or
numbers of the assistants are written or printed in the margin,
and against these the particular duty, or set of duties, to be performed
that day are written. This book is generally made up
by the deputy-librarian and checked by the librarian. In small
libraries the librarian can write up this record. Apart from its
value as a simple means of distributing and fixing duties, it makes
a capital record of visitors or callers, errors, absences of staff,
progress of certain pieces of work, checks of various kinds, and
may even be used as a staff time-book. The form given on
<a href="#Page_92">page 92</a> (<a href="#Fig7">Fig. 7</a>) is a guide to the work of a library and a check
upon results. For convenience&#8217; sake the assistants are numbered
in order of seniority.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec90">90.</h4>

<p><b>90.</b> The method of using this book is very simple. If there
are ten assistants or under, one page only is used, each member
of the staff receiving an appropriate number. If there are more
than ten assistants two pages must be used, the numbers on the
second page having the figure 1 prefixed to them, and the 10
being altered to 20. Thus page 2 will appear as 11, 12, 13, 14,
etc. If there are more than twenty assistants a third page can
be used, the existing numbers having 2 prefixed as before.</p>

<p>Each assistant on arriving or departing enters on the &#8220;Time-Sheet&#8221;
his or her exact time in the spaces reserved, beginning
the day with the first column. The assistants who check and
tidy <i>a</i> to <i>d</i> in the mornings write their initials opposite the particular
duty, while those who attend to the charging system,
date stamps, overdues and cash for change also initial the item,
the amount of change being stated. Against each assistant&#8217;s
number is written his or her duties for the day. The first page
or pages of the work book should be reserved as a key, and the
names of the assistants should be written against the numbers
which represent them. The column &#8220;New Orders&#8221; is for new
instructions for all the staff. These should be entered briefly
in red ink from the bottom towards the top of the page. The
Notes lines will receive all items specified and any other notable
incidents occurring in the course of each day, such as &#8220;Breakdown
of Electric Light,&#8221; &#8220;Drunken man expelled,&#8221; etc. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
work book must be kept in <i>one</i> recognized place, and every
assistant should be held responsible for entering up his own
notes and time. Any note of a general kind must be entered
by the senior officer present on duty. The work book should
be submitted to the chief librarian every morning.</p>

<p class="noindent blankbefore">It will be seen that these &#8220;actual&#8221; figures are full of anomalies
and divergences, and the inadequacy of payment they reveal
is in some grades positively remarkable. The European War
has produced conditions under which it is impossible for many
of these payments to sustain life, and the case for better payment
is an imperative one. At the same time the argument is not for
increased salaries out of <i>present</i> library means, but for increased
library means wherewith to pay increased salaries. Any other
course, in present circumstances, would lead many libraries into
bankruptcy. Salaries are subject to deduction, in the case of
assistants earning less than &pound;250 per annum, for National Health
Insurance; and in some towns having superannuation schemes,
contributions, amounting on the average to 2<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> per cent., are
exacted for that purpose.</p>

<p class="noindent blankbefore">(Thus, an assistant must, as a rule, wait ten years in order to
earn two pounds a week!) All salaries, whether paid monthly
or weekly, should not be subject to any deduction on account of
absences from illness (except in so far as the matter is governed
by National Health Insurance rules), holidays, or other causes.
The annual increases should only be granted provided the report
of the chief librarian is satisfactory. No assistant should be
allowed to hold the view that increases in salary are automatic
and not dependent upon satisfactory service. It is a good plan
to arrange for the whole of the staff increases to become due at
the same date, so that they can all be considered at one meeting
of the committee.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec92">92. Vacation.</h4>

<p><b>92. Vacation.</b>&mdash;The time granted for annual holidays ranges
from three weeks or more for deputy librarians and departmental
librarians to one week for juniors. A week or ten days is not
sufficient for rest and change, and a fortnight is the minimum
that should be allowed.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec93">93. Staff Training.</h4>

<p><b>93. Staff Training.</b>&mdash;In present circumstances every library
should have a definite official system of training for its staff, and
every assistance in and inducement to study should be given.
The low salaries paid in libraries demand that assistants shall at
least receive in part return the best equipment that can be given
them. The first essential is general education approximating to
matriculation, and definite study of <i>literature</i> should be required
from the first year. Where such training has not been acquired
previously, junior assistants should be required to read in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
manner that they may at the age of sixteen take the Preliminary
Test offered by the Library Association, and no assistant should
be retained permanently, in his own interests as well as in those
of the library, who is unable to pass that Test. Not until the
Test is passed should assistants be encouraged to study the
more technical divisions of the Library Association syllabus.
Chief librarians should supervise the training of the whole staff
and hold periodical brief examinations to convince themselves
that it is being pursued systematically. Every librarian-in-charge
should be held responsible for directing the studies of his
subordinates, and in small libraries the deputy-librarian should
assume this duty. Some libraries have staff guilds which hold
regular classes, sometimes with outside teachers in special subjects;
and the plan is to be commended. All books that may
be required should be provided by the library, and class fees and
examination expenses are paid in many towns&mdash;a method which
deserves universal adoption. Every professional certificate won
should command some financial recompense, however small;
and, other things being equal, promotion should be given only
to assistants who hold certificates. In a few libraries, but in an
increasing number, a certain amount of study is allowed in official
hours; this is a matter of time-sheet arrangement, as sporadic
reading in ordinary library hours is not to be encouraged.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec94">94. The Library Economy Library.</h4>

<p><b>94. The Library Economy Library.</b>&mdash;The foundation of all
training is a collection of works on library economy and bibliography.
A library without this is not properly equipped, and
some libraries have much to seek in the matter. Every recognized
text-book on the theory and practice of every department
of librarianship, all library periodicals, the best examples of
catalogues, bulletins, reading lists, annual reports, and the
standard bibliographies, should be available on the freest conditions
to the whole staff. Some libraries set apart a definite fund
for the purchase of such works; and its expenditure is one of
the best ultimate economies in which a committee can engage.
Moreover, the institution which ostensibly provides the literature
of all other professions is obviously in a ridiculous position if it
does not provide the literature of librarianship. In <a href="#AppII">Appendix II.</a>
we give a list of the works which should form the professional
collection of every library of average size; and even small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
libraries should endeavour to become possessed of the majority
of them.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec95">95. Women Librarians and Assistants.</h4>

<p><b>95. Women Librarians and Assistants.</b>&mdash;The employment of
women in libraries is not universal in this country, and very few
women hold the position of chief librarian, and these only of
small libraries. In the United States the proportion of women
librarians and assistants is nearer 95 per cent. than the 14 or 15
per cent. of Britain. There can hardly be a doubt, however, that
women will be more extensively employed in British municipal
libraries than they have been hitherto. In large towns it is
becoming increasingly difficult to obtain and retain the services
of intelligent lads who will devote themselves to the work, and
it is unnecessary to affirm nowadays that a well-educated, intelligent
girl is just as suitable for public library work as a well-educated
lad. If women are employed in libraries, they should
be paid at the same rate as men or lads performing similar duties.
There is no reason why a woman should be paid less than a man
for doing exactly the same work. Everything recommended
regarding qualifications, duties, etc., should apply to women as
well as to men. It is the opinion of some librarians that, if
women are employed, the staff should be composed entirely of
them, as a mixed staff requires various kinds of separate
accommodation.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec96">96. Caretakers.</h4>

<p><b>96. Caretakers.</b>&mdash;A satisfactory janitor or caretaker, generally
speaking, is a valuable member of staff, and is rare. A good
man seldom stays very long, so easy is it for him to seek and
obtain promotion. Caretakers&#8217; wages vary all over the country,
according to the size of the library, amount of work and perquisites.
In cases where a residence is provided, it is usual to
secure the services of a man and his wife, and furnish him with
a uniform and the usual light, coal, etc. In such cases the wages
are usually less than when a man has to find his own residence.
From 25s. to 30s. weekly is the wage given when a house is provided.
In other instances, according to circumstances, the
wages vary from 27s. 6d. to 50s. weekly. In large libraries extra
assistance should always be provided, and the cleaning should
be done early in the morning, before the hour of opening. A
sufficient staff of cleaners should be provided to enable this to
be done without interfering with the service of the public.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
Three hours every morning should suffice to clean any library,
and it is important to employ plenty of help. The wages of
cleaners vary from 9d. an hour downwards, but it is more often
the practice to pay so much a week according to circumstances.
Rates for this class of work differ so much that it is impossible
to do more than roughly indicate a possible basis.</p>

<p>A caretaker should be made responsible to the librarian for
the cleanness and order of the building, and his duties should
include a certain number of hours&#8217; attendance in uniform as
general overseer of the rooms and their frequenters. It is imperative
that this official should not be allowed to develop the
attitude of a Jack-in-office, and in all his patrol work courtesy
and firmness should be required. Eight or nine hours daily should
be considered full time for a caretaker, and suitable arrangements
must be made to enable him to remain off duty at hours when
the business is quiet. In large libraries it is customary to employ
more than one janitor or caretaker.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec97">97. Staff and Public.</h4>

<p><b>97. Staff and Public.</b>&mdash;It is most important that good relations
should exist between readers and the whole of the staff. It is
a well-known fact that one or two overbearing assistants can
render a public library more unpopular than almost anything
else. Assistants should school themselves to endure with philosophy
the impertinence of the small number of the general public
who contrive to make themselves objectionable in every town,
and not visit on the heads of the inoffensive majority the sins
of the inconsiderate few. The staff of every public library should
learn as a first lesson that they are the servants and not the
masters of the people, and that mutual self-respect can be maintained
without undue familiarity on the one side or aloofness on
the other. The supercilious &#8220;official&#8221; attitude, with which
public servants are so frequently credited, is to be completely
repressed and kept under, and the public should be taught to
appreciate their own libraries, and to understand that the doors
of a municipal library are always open to receive and welcome
every class of citizen. At the same time, preference should not
be shown for any particular frequenter or group of frequenters,
and gossiping must be suppressed.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec98">98. Staff Accommodation.</h4>

<p><b>98. Staff Accommodation.</b>&mdash;In libraries of every size private
rooms of suitable dimensions should be provided for the librarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and the assistants; with work- and store-rooms for the staff
and caretaker. The librarian&#8217;s room in small libraries may be
made large enough to serve as a committee room, and in all
cases should have separate lavatory accommodation. A large
safe or strong room is often attached to the librarian&#8217;s room, or
in a secure part of the basement, in which to store valuable
documents and books. It should be shelved to contain such
documents as registers, minutes and other local records in a
convenient manner, and should be kept well ventilated and dry
for the safe preservation of its contents. Strong rooms vary in
size from 4 feet &times; 6 feet &times; 8 feet, to large apartments 20 feet &times;
20 feet and upwards. The usual furnishings of a librarian&#8217;s room
comprise a desk, table, bookshelves, chairs, hat and umbrella
stand, and other office furniture. Staff mess-rooms should be
fitted with tables, chairs, cupboards, with a locker for each
assistant, cooking apparatus and other appliances. Work-rooms
for staff use must be fitted to suit the class of work carried on,
whether cataloguing or preparing books, binding or filing. Store-rooms
for general purposes and for the use of the caretaker should
also be provided, fitted with all necessary cupboards and shelving.
Separate staff rooms and lavatory accommodation should be
provided in libraries with staffs composed partly of men, partly
of women.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="title">LIBRARY ASSOCIATIONS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec99">99.</h4>

<p><b>99.</b> Although there is no such co-ordination of libraries as there
is of schools under central Government control, and therefore
not the same apparent necessity for combination amongst
librarians, the library profession is closely linked by means of
library societies to which every librarian with any claims to
consideration is attached. The largest of these societies is the
American Library Association, which has nearly 4000 members;
and many continental European countries have such societies.
In the United Kingdom the principal societies are the Library
Association and its branches, and the Library Assistants&#8217;
Association.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec100">100. The Library Association.</h4>

<p><b>100. The Library Association.</b>&mdash;This body, which is the centre
and controlling force of British librarianship, was founded in
1877 at the First International Library Conference, which was
held in London. In 1898 it received a Royal Charter by which
it became the responsible representative body of the profession.
Its objects as set out in the Charter are to unite all persons
engaged or interested in libraries by means of conferences and
meetings for the discussion of bibliography and all other phases
of librarianship; to promote the better administration of
libraries; to improve the position and qualifications of
librarians; to promote the adoption of the Public Libraries
Acts and the establishment of reference and lending libraries
for use by the public; to watch and promote legislation affecting
public libraries; to encourage bibliographical study and research;
to publish information of service to the members or which in
any way furthers the interests of the Association; to collect
and maintain a library and museum; to hold examinations in
librarianship and to issue certificates of efficiency; and to
maintain in every lawful way the interests of libraries and
their workers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>The Association is not purely professional. It seeks the
co-operation in membership of library authorities, members of
library committees and all persons who are interested in libraries,
as well as library workers themselves. The presidency of the
Association has until quite recently usually been held by a public
man who was not a librarian. The executive is a council consisting
of president, past presidents, honorary secretary, solicitor
and treasurer, and twelve members of any grade representing
London, and twenty representing the remainder of the United
Kingdom, who, with the exception of the past presidents, are
elected annually.</p>

<p>The membership consists of Honorary Fellows, Fellows,
Members, Associate Members and Student Members. The
<i>Honorary Fellowship</i> is given for distinguished service to the
objects of the Association; <i>Fellows</i> are holders of the Library
Association diploma, chief librarians who held office before
December 1914, and, in some instances, librarians who are
graduates of universities; <i>Members</i> are
librarians<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> who hold four
professional certificates and have had three years&#8217; approved
library experience, or librarians 25 years of age or more, who
held office before December 1914 and have had not less than six
years&#8217; approved experience; <i>Associate Members</i> are librarians
not qualified as Fellows or Members, and non-librarians; <i>Student
Members</i> are persons under 25 years of age who are studying
for librarianship; and libraries and institutions are received as
<i>Institution Members</i>. Fellows and Members have the right of
using the initials F.L.A. and M.L.A. respectively after their
names so long as they remain subscribing members. The
entrance fee to all grades of membership is one guinea, and
the annual subscription is also one guinea, except for Student
Members, who pay a half-guinea yearly.</p>

<p>The scheme of classification of members set out in the last
paragraph has been in operation since 1914, and in course of time
the classes will show the degrees of qualification possessed by
their members. In 1914, however, many quite undistinguished
people were made Fellows simply because they held the chief
office in a library, however small or badly managed that institution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
might be. Hereafter, if the Council carries out its duties
properly, as there is every reason to believe it will, only men
and women qualified by a searching examination will become
Fellows or Members. All classes of members (except student
members, who do not vote) enjoy equal privileges in the
Association.</p>

<p>The Association holds monthly meetings from about November
to June in London, at which professional papers are read and
discussed. It also holds an Annual Conference, usually early in
September, when it is generally the guest of some municipality,
and when the greater part of its members foregather for the
discussion of library questions. The Annual Conference is the
principal library event of the year, and every library worker
who can should attend, as more is to be learned during that
week than in many months of solitary reading or study of library
problems. Library committees should not only encourage their
librarians to attend; they should send delegates of their own
members, and in the case both of these and of the librarians,
defray their expenses. The papers and discussions are
published in <i>The Library Association Record</i>, the monthly
official journal of the Association, which is issued free to all
members.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a>
The word &#8220;librarian&#8221; includes &#8220;library assistant.&#8221; After all, &#8220;librarian&#8221;
is the name of a member of a profession, not the holder of a position.</p></div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec101">101. Educational Work.</h4>

<p><b>101. Educational Work.</b>&mdash;From the standpoint of this book
the most interesting part of the Association&#8217;s work is that of its
Education Committee. The Committee holds examinations
yearly in May, and the scheme of examination for the Diploma
includes six provisional examinations, a language test, a thesis,
and, if desirable, further oral examination, etc., as follows:</p>

<p class="hind0_2 blankbefore">(<i>a</i>) Provisional certificates are granted for:</p>

<ul class="nostyle">

<li>1. Literary History.</li>
<li>2. Elements of Practical Bibliography.</li>
<li>3. Classification.</li>
<li>4. Cataloguing.</li>
<li>5. Library History, Foundation and Equipment.</li>
<li>6. Library Routine.</li>

</ul>

<p class="hind0_2 blankbefore">(<i>b</i>) A satisfactory essay upon some aspect of each of the above
subjects is required as part of the examination.</p>

<p class="hind0_2">(<i>c</i>) Practical experience of not less than 24 hours a week for
at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
least 3 years as a member of the administrative staff of one
or more libraries approved by the Council.</p>

<p class="hind0_2">(<i>d</i>) A thesis showing original thought or research on some subject
within the purview of the syllabus, the subject being
previously approved by the Council.</p>

<p class="hind0_2">(<i>e</i>) A certificate approved by the Council, showing an elementary
knowledge of Latin or Greek, and one modern foreign language.
In the absence of such certificates the candidates
may be examined by gentlemen appointed by the Council.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">Each of the examinations may at present be taken separately;
and the method of preparation is left to the individual candidates.
It may be by individual reading, by the correspondence
classes provided by the Association, or by attendance at the
courses of lectures which the Association also provides. No
student, however, is admitted to the examination who has not
passed matriculation, the senior Oxford or Cambridge Local, or
some similar examination. For those who cannot obtain one of
these certificates, the Association prescribes its own Preliminary
Test (held in May and October), which consists of papers in
the general school subjects and in such matters as will test
the candidate&#8217;s powers of observation and his common sense.
The Association publishes a yearly <i>Syllabus</i> setting forth in detail
these conditions, a detailed synopsis of the required subjects,
lists of text-books, classes, etc., and a full list of certificate-holders.</p>

<p>The address of the Association is at Caxton Hall, Westminster,
London.</p>

<p>We conclude these remarks by saying that librarians may be
judged by their relations with the Library Association. Membership
is in a broad sense the seal upon their experience and
qualifications; and the catholicity of the Association&#8217;s educational
work and its record of activity on behalf of libraries and
librarians command the respect and adherence of all who are
likely to read this book. No library worker of whatever grade
whose income exceeds &pound;100 a year should consider it consistent
with his self-respect to remain outside this Association.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec102">102. The Library Assistants&#8217; Association.</h4>

<p><b>102. The Library Assistants&#8217; Association.</b>&mdash;This is a purely
sectional association for assistants in municipal and institutional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
(but not commercial lending) libraries, and was founded in 1895
by the members of one of the Library Association Summer
Schools, to educate and to protect the special interests of
assistants, and to provide them with a freer platform than the
Library Association seemed to offer. By means of monthly
meetings held throughout the winter at various libraries, the
reading of papers, discussions, etc.; by study circles, summer
schools, international visits to libraries, and other activities, it
has changed for the better the whole tone of the library service,
and has won for itself a distinct place amongst professional
associations.</p>

<p>It is organized on lines similar to those of the Library Association,
being governed by a President, Honorary Treasurer, and
Honorary Secretary and a Council of ten London and ten non-London
members. Its membership is of <i>Honorary Fellows</i>,
elected for special distinction or services; <i>Fellows</i> who are chief
librarians who were formerly members; <i>Members</i>, assistant
librarians earning salaries of &pound;52 per annum and more; and
<i>Associates</i>, assistants earning less than &pound;52. The Association
has several branches; maintains a good professional library
(housed at the Central Public Library, Islington); issues free
to all members a monthly journal, <i>The Library Assistant</i>; and
has been responsible for various valuable brief publications
included in the &#8220;L.A.A. Series.&#8221; The subscriptions for membership
are 5s. per annum for Fellows and Members, and 2s. 6d.
for Associates.</p>

<p>The value of the Association has been widely recognized, and
library assistants, of whatever age or rank, would serve their
own interests and those of their profession by adhering to it.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec103">103. Other Societies.</h4>

<p><b>103. Other Societies.</b>&mdash;Other purely library Societies which
may be mentioned are the Panizzi Club and the Society of Public
Librarians. The Panizzi Club, which was founded in 1914, is
mainly composed of university, Government and institutional&mdash;but
not municipal&mdash;librarians. It has not yet published any
proceedings, and is interested in the compiling of co-operative
bibliographies, and in doing such other work as will co-ordinate
and improve the service of the libraries it represents. The
Society of Public Librarians is a small body of librarians which
meets in London for the reading and discussion of papers. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
does not seek to add to its membership except by the nomination
of existing members.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec104">104.</h4>

<p><b>104.</b> Societies which are not mainly for librarians, but which
are of considerable interest to them, are the Bibliographical
Society and the Museums Association. The Bibliographical
Society, founded in 1892, has its headquarters at 20 Hanover
Square, London, W.1, and exists for the promoting of the study
of the book and manuscript mainly in their historical and bibliographical
characteristics. It meets monthly for the reading and
discussion of papers, and publishes, to members only, valuable
works on matters within its province. The annual subscription
is one guinea, and the entrance fee is a similar sum.</p>

<p>The Museums Association, founded in 1889, has for its object
the bringing together of museum officials, members of museum
committees, and others interested in museum work for mutual
discussion and help. Its membership is made up of persons who
pay a subscription of one guinea per annum, and associates who
pay a half-guinea. An annual meeting, usually lasting four days,
is held in July, when papers are read and discussed. The
<i>Museums Journal</i>, published monthly, contains the transactions.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec105">105. Staff Guilds, etc.</h4>

<p><b>105. Staff Guilds, etc.</b>&mdash;It will be appropriate to say a little here
about the private organizations of library staffs, known as guilds,
or clubs, which are becoming a feature of larger libraries here
and in America. The members of the staff band themselves
together for mutual improvement and recreation with a committee
chosen of their own numbers to direct their activities.
These latter include classes in library economy, literature, and
other subjects of interest to assistants for the younger members
of the staff, and reading circles, elocution classes, etc., for the
older ones. Recreations, as cricket, swimming, walking, photography
and other sports, are also arranged by the guilds; and at
Croydon there is an annual excursion which is recognized by the
public, the libraries being closed for the purpose on the chosen
day. Croydon, Fulham and Glasgow have issued staff magazines
in connection with their clubs; these are usually cyclostyled
publications. The Islington club has distinguished itself
for social gatherings, and the New Year&#8217;s gathering of the
Glasgow club is one of the features of the library year. Wisely
conducted, these guilds have a great influence for good, are an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
incentive to study, and produce that better work which comes
from mutual understanding amongst library workers. They
should be recognized by the library committee and the chief
librarian, but should be perfectly autonomous.</p>

<h2>DIVISION IV<br />
BUILDINGS</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="title">THEORY AND GENERAL REMARKS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec107">107. Theory.</h4>

<p><b>107. Theory.</b>&mdash;Although the subject of library buildings has
been frequently treated by various writers, there is a lack of
literature on the important question of size limitation and the
modifications arising therefrom. Controversy has raged round
such questions as stacks <i>versus</i> alcoves, general <i>versus</i> special
reading rooms, general <i>versus</i> separate book stores, and so on,
but on the much more important question, &#8220;What size is the
library to be?&#8221; hardly any theories or definite statements exist.
Beyond a vague general recommendation to secure as large a
site as possible, in view of future extension, writers on library
architecture have not committed themselves to any principle
which would guide those responsible for new library buildings
in estimating the provision to be made. The chief reason for
this is no doubt the cherished tradition that libraries are to be
made as large as possible, because they are the repositories of
the literature of the ages and the storehouse for every kind of
printed matter. The <i>museum</i> idea of a public library, however,
is now giving place to the <i>workshop</i> idea, and few librarians
nowadays of average-sized municipal libraries hold the view that
it is their function to provide and retain every book, irrespective
of its value or appeal, and to attempt to rival the British Museum
or Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale on a reduced scale.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec108">108.</h4>

<p><b>108.</b> There are several very important considerations to be
advanced in favour of limiting libraries both as regards book
storage and accommodation for readers, and these shall be set
out in order. However much one may sympathize with the
view that all public libraries ought to collect <i>everything</i>&mdash;on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
grounds that it may one day be used, and that nothing which
illustrates past life, customs, etc., should be ignored&mdash;it is only
fair to point out that this work is already being done effectively
by general or special libraries in all parts of the country. This
particular form of literature conservation is the chief province
of the great State libraries like the British Museum, Patent
Office, India Office, National Libraries of Ireland and Wales, etc.;
the university libraries; the endowed or special libraries like the
Advocates&#8217; (Edinburgh), Mitchell (Glasgow), John Rylands
(Manchester); the great proprietary libraries of a special kind
like the Royal Colonial Institute, Athen&aelig;um Club, Signet (Edinburgh),
London Library, etc.; and scientific, law and collegiate
libraries of all kinds. The burden of carrying on this tradition
of universal garnering need not be borne by municipal libraries,
except in the case of great towns such as Birmingham, Glasgow,
Liverpool, Manchester and Bristol, where the libraries may
reasonably be expected to be as representative as possible.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec109">109.</h4>

<p><b>109.</b> The workshop form of public library provides for the
systematic and continuous revision of the stock of the library,
and in this way it becomes practicable to fix a rough limit to
the size of a building. This is a most important matter, because
it is undoubtedly the result of a general cultivation of the museum
idea which has led to the formation of some municipal libraries,
a great portion of whose contents could be discarded without
perceptible inconvenience to anyone. While the wisdom of
acquiring additional land for future extension, should it be
required, can be admitted, the wisdom of erecting and furnishing
large buildings on the assumption that they ought to be filled
as speedily as possible can be questioned safely. The result of
overbuilding is to cripple the early and most critical years of
the library&#8217;s existence with heavy loans and their repayment,
while the upkeep of a great building ultimately designed to
accommodate 100,000 volumes and 500 readers, though starting
with only 10,000 volumes and 100 readers, is sure to be out of
all proportion. Library buildings should bear some proportion
to the funds available for their maintenance and the percentage
of the public they are likely to attract.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec110">110.</h4>

<p><b>110.</b> The chief danger with most library authorities is the
tendency to erect a library building having no relation to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
funds available for its maintenance. The laudable desire for a
handsome architectural exterior, which all public buildings ought
to have, is frequently carried to such an extent that utility is
completely sacrificed to an ornamental outside appearance.
Where funds are plentiful, as they would be without a limited
rate, there is no reason why a fine-looking building should not
be provided, but where money is strictly limited it is necessary
to consider the plans rather than the elevation. In any case,
the interior arrangements should never be subordinated to the
desire for mere outward show and ornament, and a library
building in the hands of a competent architect can be made of a
suitable and dignified design notwithstanding the rate limitation.
In too many cases most of the money provided for library
buildings has been spent on the structure, with the result that
the interior fittings have been cut down to the cheapest and
meanest varieties. The outside of a library building is its least
important feature, and should never be so extravagant as to
imperil the utility and appearance of the interior arrangements.
There are library buildings now existing on which much money
has been lavished apparently for the purpose of providing fa&ccedil;ades
to dazzle the townsfolk, but which, nevertheless, are not only
inconveniently planned inside, but furnished and fitted up in a
style which suggests a kitchen rather than a public institution.
This is often brought about by a wrong division of the money
borrowed for building and furnishing purposes. A sum is set
apart for furniture, which would be ample if such permanent
fittings as bookshelves, counters, screens, etc., were not included.
But when these are provided out of a furniture loan it is seldom
that a large enough sum is borrowed. It is important to remember
that such fittings as bookcases, counters, screens, wall newspaper
slopes, barriers, lifts, galleries, etc., form permanent parts
of the building, and ought to be included in the building loan,
which can be borrowed for thirty years. A furniture loan must
be repaid within ten years, and only such <i>movable</i> items as
tables, chairs, desks, office furniture, etc., should be bought
from this fund.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec111">111.</h4>

<p><b>111.</b> Assuming, also, that a building must be provided which
will bear some relation to the number of persons who will be
attracted, the stock to be housed, and the funds available for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
maintenance, the following factors are presented as a basis from
which estimates can be made<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>It has been definitely ascertained that 6 per cent. of the
population of the average town become borrowers. For this
number the average stock of books provided in lending libraries
is three per borrower. Books are kept out on an average ten
days each, or twelve days non-fiction, eight days fiction. In a
year of 306 days each borrower will read about thirty books.
Here, then, is a basis from which to start in providing accommodation
for a lending library. If a town has 50,000 inhabitants,
it will attract 3000 borrowers, who will require
9000 volumes as a minimum lending stock. The annual issue
should be 90,000 volumes. It follows that the minimum lending
library accommodation in a case like this should comprise
shelving for 9000 volumes, and lobby or other spaces for at
least seventy-five persons present at one time. In theory an
issue of 300 per day should mean an average hourly attendance
of thirty per hour, but in actual practice it must be recognized
that borrowers attend at uncertain parts of the day, and most
commonly during the last two or three hours in the evening;
therefore it is safe to allow for the accommodation of at least
one-fourth of the daily average number of visitors. Many
lending libraries are overshelved owing to a failure to recognize
the possibility of revision of stock and the equally important
fact that the best shelving for books is in the homes of the
people.</p>

<p>The same rules apply to all the other departments.</p>

<span class="title">SITES AND PLANS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec112">112.</h4>

<p><b>112.</b> This chapter is of a purely practical character,
with illustrations from well-known examples of library plans.
Except in the necessary precautionary remarks made already,
it has been thought undesirable to dwell upon the elevations of
libraries and the relative desirability of fa&ccedil;ades, although much
might be said upon the subject and it is worthy of careful attention.
Such a discussion, however, could be useful only if a long
series of illustrations were given ranging say from the New York
and Pittsburgh public libraries, the National Library of Wales,
the Liverpool Public Library and the Mitchell Library at Glasgow,
which are large and handsome architectural edifices, to the more
modest but satisfactory small buildings such as those at Bromley,
Herne Hill and Wallasey. Although a certain common character
is to be found in smaller municipal library elevations, and
especially in Carnegie libraries, there is no distinctive type of
elevation peculiar to libraries which immediately suggests the
purpose of the buildings. This is one of the things to be
desired in British architecture, as it is fair to expect that such
buildings should be both artistic and appropriate, if such results
can be reached without the sacrifice of even more important
considerations.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec113">113.</h4>

<p><b>113.</b> It is premised that all central libraries require certain
departments, including reference and lending libraries, newspaper
room, magazine (or periodicals) room, children&#8217;s room,
lecture room, and administrative departments&mdash;librarian&#8217;s office,
cataloguing room, store rooms, staff rooms, cloak rooms, etc.
Too often the provision made for administrative and staff purposes
is inadequate, and the library suffers greatly in consequence.
Branch libraries do not, as a rule, have reference rooms, although
accommodation for a collection of quick-reference books is
necessary, and in many branch libraries newspaper and magazine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
rooms are combined. All the apartments premised above are
not present in all buildings. Older libraries have no separate
provision for children, and indeed work with children on a large
scale is quite a recent development of library activity, but the
desirability of such a department is made clear in <a href="#Page_439">Division XIII.</a>
Lecture rooms are rarer still, because of the peculiar view taken
by legal authority that lectures are not within the province of
libraries; and in some of the larger cities lecture work is adequately
carried out by other institutions. A modern librarian,
however, regards a lecture room as a necessary part of his building,
and even in the larger cities lectures which are purely library
lectures, having a direct bearing upon the use of books, can be
given satisfactorily only in direct connexion with the library.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec114">114. Sites.</h4>

<p><b>114. Sites.</b>&mdash;In choosing sites for public library buildings
committees should bear in mind the following principles<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80 blankbefore">1. They should be central and easily accessible from all parts of the
district, by tramways or other conveyances.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">2. They should be as far as possible isolated from all other buildings,
particularly shops.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">3. Quiet side streets are preferable to noisy main thoroughfares.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">4. Level sites are preferable to those on steep gradients.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">5. More ground than is required for immediate use should be secured if
possible.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">A large number of the public libraries of the country are
erected upon land which has been presented to the towns, and
an endeavour should be made to procure a gift of this kind
before a purchase is made. It will make a considerable difference
to the size and quality of the building which can be provided
if land has to be purchased. Frequently land can be secured upon
a long lease at a nominal or peppercorn rent, and when this can
be done it is better than borrowing more money than the rate
will allow, and thereby crippling the library in its early years.
In the tables in <a href="#Sec31">Section 31</a> no direct provision is made for loans
for sites, but if it is necessary that money must be borrowed for
the purpose, the margin which is mentioned as arising from
incidental receipts, will probably meet the annual repayments
of a loan spread over fifty years, if the site and its purchase
money are not excessive. But in any case, let the advice to
committees be reiterated not to borrow money for sites till they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
have exhausted every hope of inducing some public-spirited
citizen or public body to come forward with a gift of land. This
is the only way, save in towns with very large incomes, in which
the inadequate provisions of the Public Libraries Acts can be
in part overcome. At the same time it should be remembered
that by these and other Acts of Parliament special power is
given to town councils and other public bodies to convey land
to library authorities for building purposes.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec115">115. The Architect.</h4>

<p><b>115. The Architect.</b>&mdash;When a suitable site has been secured
it is usual to institute a competition for the planning and design
of the building. This is not necessarily the best method; indeed,
we are of opinion that more satisfactory results are obtained if a
reputable architect is engaged without competition other than
his previous record establishes for him in comparison with other
architects, who will carry out the directions of the committee.
The importance of appointing a professional librarian before any
serious step is taken or permanent arrangement is made has
already been pointed out. No plan should be drawn up or
accepted without such skilled guidance as he can give. The
mistakes made in the past through neglect of this precaution
are a warning to committees never to trust to their own choice
and judgment, and not to rely entirely upon an architect, who
is often unacquainted with the best arrangements for working
a public library, however great his artistic and technical qualifications
may be. Assuming that a competent librarian has
been appointed, the first thing to do after securing a site is to
determine the size and kind of building required, and to make
out a rough plan of the interior arrangements and prepare a
specification of requirements or instructions to the architect.
If a competition is determined upon, a limited one is preferable
to any open one, unless there are local or other reasons against
such a course. In the case of an open competition, advertisements
should be inserted in the local papers, and in <i>The Architect</i>,
<i>Builder</i> and <i>Building News</i>, inviting architects to compete,
and asking them to apply for the conditions. Premiums should
be fixed for the designs placed first, second and third in order of
merit by the assessor who judges the plans. These must be
regulated by the size and style of the building. &pound;50, &pound;30 and
&pound;20 have been offered for buildings costing &pound;4000 and
upwards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
Premiated designs become the property of the committee. The
Royal Institute of British Architects, London, should be asked
to nominate an assessor at a fee to be determined, and of course
such assessor will not be a competitor. It is usual to merge
the premium of the successful architect whose design is carried
out into the fee paid him for superintending the work, which
amounts to 5 per cent. on the cost of the building, including
all extras.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec116">116. Instructions and Plan.</h4>

<p><b>116. Instructions and Plan.</b>&mdash;The instructions to the competitors
should be accompanied by a plan of the site drawn to
quarter- or eighth-inch scale, and showing building line and
ancient lights, if any. They should specify the amount and
kind of accommodation required on each floor, and state that
the cost should not exceed a certain sum exclusive of movable
furniture. Permanent fittings should include bookcases, wall
and standard; screens, counters, wall slopes for newspapers,
barriers, and any other kind of fixture. The conditions as
regards premiums, assessing, etc., should be sent with the instructions
and site plan. All competitive designs should be drawn
to the same scale (one-fourth or one-eighth inch), and should
be finished in black without colour or ornament. Perspective
drawings, in addition to elevations, may be sent at the discretion
of each competitor. Each set of drawings should include a
plan of every floor, showing proposed arrangement of bookcases,
counters, furniture, etc.; an elevation of every face; and a
section through the building both ways. Plenty of time should
be allowed for the sending in of designs; three months at least
from date of advertisement. Usually the assessor draws up the
instructions, and afterwards circulates answers to any questions
which may be put by the competitors.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec117">117. Selection of Plan.</h4>

<p><b>117. Selection of Plan.</b>&mdash;The competing drawings should be
sent in unmarked in any way, but should be numbered in order
of receipt, so that the assessor and committee cannot recognize
the author. The competitor&#8217;s name and address should be sent
separately in a sealed envelope marked on the outside with the
same number, and some such words as &#8220;architect&#8217;s name and
address,&#8221; to prevent accidental opening. It is the duty of the
assessor to advise the committee as to the practicability of every
design; to determine if it is in accordance with the instructions;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
to ascertain if it can be carried out for the amount stated; and
to judge which designs are first, second and third in order of merit
after fulfilling the conditions of the instructions.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec118">118.</h4>

<p><b>118.</b> The following rules for judging library plans will be found
useful; they are based on a wide experience of planning in all
its departments, and can be used by architectural assessors and
librarians as a guide<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80 blankbefore"><span class="padl1">1</span>. No public room should be made a thoroughfare leading to any other
public room.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80"><span class="padl1">2</span>. All exits from public rooms should be within view of the staff.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80"><span class="padl1">3</span>. Oversight of public rooms should, if possible, be secured without the
need for special officers in every room. For this purpose ornamental
glazed partitions are preferable to solid walls.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80"><span class="padl1">4</span>. No passage for public traffic should be less than 4 feet wide. Where
movable chairs are used the passages should be from 6 to 8 feet wide.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80"><span class="padl1">5</span>. Cross gangways between table and bookcase-ends should not be less
than 3 feet if used as thoroughfares, but may be 2 feet only if simply
spaces to enable readers or assistants to pass round.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80"><span class="padl1">6</span>. Bookcases should not exceed 7 feet 6 inches in height either in open
access or closed libraries, and shelves should be of the uniform length
of 3 feet, unless for folio and quarto stock, when 18 inches will be
found better. For fiction wall shelves in open access libraries, the
depth should not exceed 7 inches.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80" id="Ref01"><span class="padl1">7</span>. Standard bookcases in open access libraries should be spaced at not
less than 6 feet apart when facing each other, and in closed libraries
at not less than 3 feet apart.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80"><span class="padl1">8</span>. Magazine room readers should be allowed not less than 12 superficial
feet each, including table and passage room.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80"><span class="padl1">9</span>. Reference library readers should be allowed not less than 18 superficial
feet, including table and passage room.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">10. Where indicators are used in lending libraries the counter space should
provide 5 feet run for every 4000 volumes stored, or 15 inches per
1000 numbers, and at least 10 feet run of clear space for service.
The public space in front of any such counter should not be less than
10 feet wide, unless in a very small library, when it may be 6.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">11. In open access lending libraries the spaces should not be less than
those shown in <a href="#Ref01">No. 7</a> above. As a general rule it will be found
easy and fairly accurate to allow 20 square feet to every borrower
estimated to be present at one time, and disregard the provision
of stock. In this calculation allowance is made for gangways, stock
and readers.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">12. Allow nine volumes per foot run in lending library shelving, and
eight volumes per foot run in reference library shelving. A 7 foot 6
inch bookcase should give an average of eight shelves per tier in a
lending library, and about the same in a reference library, if separate
provision is made in wall cases for folio and other large books.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">13. Public lobbies and staircases must be arranged according to the rules
laid down by any local or general building act or bye-law.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">14. Newspaper slopes should allow an average of 4 feet run for every paper.
This will provide for spaces between papers.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">In some towns the competition designs for library buildings have
been placed on exhibition, to enable the public and other interested
persons to compare the premiated with the other drawings.
This seems an admirable procedure, regarded as a mere matter
of policy, but the practical advantage is somewhat doubtful.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec119">119. Library Planning.</h4>

<p><b>119. Library Planning.</b>&mdash;In subsequent chapters are set out
in detail some of the chief requirements of the different departments
of a public library, and here may be noted a few general
principles, illustrated with plans. It is impossible to fix any
data which will apply to all sizes and shapes of sites, on account
of differences introduced by difficulties of lighting, approaches
and varying local requirements. The data given above (<a href="#Sec118">Section
118</a>) can be applied in most cases, as dimensions of this class
seldom vary, but any additional data are certain to be modified
by local conditions.</p>

<p>The chief principle to be emphasized is the one already stated,
that public libraries should be constructed and stocked with the
view to constant revision, and that their size should be limited
by the number of <i>live</i> books likely to be wanted at any period.
It is difficult to say what the number of actually living books
will be at any given period, but judging by the selections which
have been made in histories of literature and in such books as
Sonnenschein&#8217;s <i>Best Books</i>, it may be roughly estimated that
there are about 50,000 works of perennial interest which are
worth storing in a modern workshop library. Even this number
could be reduced by one-half and still be made fairly representative
of every literature, period and subject of human
interest. In the largest municipal libraries a very considerable
proportion of the stock is composed of duplicates of popular
books in central and branch libraries, while practically one-half
of the stock of such libraries consists of literature which is rarely
used. The provision of book-storage should, therefore, be
limited in the case of municipal libraries, not so much by the
size of building which can be afforded by the income, but by
the actual living books which are likely to be required.</p>

<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo135lg.png">Fig. 11 enlarged</a></p>

<p class="blankbefore">In libraries which start with incomes of &pound;500, provision should
not be made for more than 20,000 volumes. In those with
commencing incomes of &pound;1000 to &pound;2000 room, for 40,000
volumes will be found ample. From &pound;2000 to &pound;3000, 60,000
volumes; from &pound;3000 to &pound;4000, 100,000 volumes; from &pound;4000
to &pound;5000, 130,000 volumes; from &pound;5000 to &pound;6000, 160,000
volumes, and so on. Bearing these figures in mind, the planning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
of library buildings becomes greatly simplified. The main
points to be aimed at in library planning are good light, convenient
access to rooms, a fair amount of oversight, and the
arrangement of departments so as to secure quiet in the principal
reading rooms. For this last reason the reference library should
be put farthest away from both newsroom and lending library,
so that the traffic of these departments will not disturb readers.
In small libraries it is best and most convenient to keep the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
whole of the departments on one floor, obtaining light, if necessary,
from the roof. The sketch plan, <a href="#Fig9">Fig. 9</a>, shows a convenient
arrangement for such a library.</p>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>121.</b> The principle of radiation to secure oversight and ease
of working is well illustrated in <a href="#Fig10">this plan</a>. The next plan (<a href="#Fig12">Fig.

department in a square room, and here it is obvious that considerable
loss of space is sustained in the angles. The same objection
applies to the arrangement of <a href="#Fig13">Figs. 13</a> and <a href="#Fig14">14</a>. <a href="#Fig10">Figs. 10</a> and
<a href="#Fig11">11</a> show the children&#8217;s room and general reading room on the

people go to the lending department than to the reading room,
and that the plan is therefore more convenient. In practice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
it has been found an admirable arrangement. <a href="#Fig15">Figs. 15</a> and <a href="#Fig16">16</a>
show the arrangement of a large library, fully equipped with all
departments, and in this the radial arrangement of bookcases
in the lending library has not been adopted because of the shape
of the room. Another plan on the same principle (<a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>)
illustrates an open access library without radiating bookcases,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>

for a small open access library is afforded by the Fulham

should contain a clause specifying that all extras must be
sanctioned by the library authority before being put in hand,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and must be certified by the architect when completed. It is
well to avoid extras by making a careful estimate in advance,
but if they are supplied, great precaution must be used to see
that they are limited and strictly watched.</p>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>127. Opening Ceremony, etc.</b>&mdash;There are certain ceremonial
matters connected with the laying of foundation-stones, unveiling
of memorial stones or brasses and opening ceremonies,
which each locality must arrange to suit its own needs. An
opening ceremony of a public character is always so useful in
making known a library that it ought when possible to be
arranged. It need not be a very expensive function, and if an
eminent public personage, local or otherwise, can be secured to
perform the ceremony, so much the better. It is a doubtful
point whether the expense of an opening ceremony can be
defrayed from the library rate. In districts where the expenditure
is audited by a Government auditor, a moderate sum may
be passed, with the caution not to incur such charge again, but
it is dangerous to assume that this expenditure will always be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
allowed. Such expenditure, if incurred, would not of course
include any extravagant items such as banquets, receptions, etc.,
but be confined to printing and other expenses.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec128">128.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>128.</b> The lighting, heating and ventilation of library buildings
are all matters which primarily concern the architect; and they
are seldom solved in a completely satisfactory manner. Lighting
is the one that most directly interests the librarian, as much of
the effectiveness of libraries depends upon it. A valuable discussion
upon the question took place in 1911 at joint-meetings
of the Illuminating Engineering Society and the Library Association,
at which both librarians and lighting engineers expressed
their views and experience. The matter is one for expert advice,
but librarians should be clear as to the problems to be solved
in artificial lighting; these are:</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80 blankbefore">To light reading room tables, so as to avoid glare in the eyes of readers.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">To prevent the casting of strong shadows, single or multiple.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">To avoid fixing furniture or fittings in permanent positions.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">To ensure the illumination of the room generally, as well as the tables.</p>

<p class="hind0_2 fsize80">To light the vertical spaces presented by two cases of books standing
face to face, with a narrow gangway between, so that the book-titles
on all the shelves can be read easily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p class="blankbefore">To ensure good results attention must be directed to general
lighting, which should be full in newspaper and similar rooms,
but subordinate in reference libraries; and it is recommended
that point lighting, with positions fixed and shades chosen to
prevent glare, should be used at all reading points and tables;
and if possible <i>all</i> lights should be suspended from the ceiling,
as to fix them upon furniture involves the anchoring of the
furniture to the floors or walls. In general lighting the use of
the walls and ceilings as reflectors should be remembered, and
the walls should be tinted in such colours as return the maximum
reflection. The problem of lighting gangways of books has not
been solved satisfactorily, but tube-o&#8217;-lights or line-o&#8217;-lights
fixed on the top cornice of cases have given good results. Lights
centred above gangways are the most usual method, but these
produce shadows. We can touch upon this subject only briefly,
but the gravest thought should be given to it, as systems of
lighting which are most effective architecturally are often quite
useless for library purposes.</p>

<p>The ventilation of the rooms should be thorough and yet
exclude draughts; and on this matter, as upon the kindred
matter of heating, we cannot do more here than refer to the
recent literature upon those subjects.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="title">MISCELLANEOUS FIXTURES AND FITTINGS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec130">130.</h4>

<p><b>130.</b> It is important to note that all fittings which are fixtures,
as are most of those about to be described in the following
chapter, should be regarded as part of the permanent structure,
and not as movable furniture. Such fittings should be included
in the loan raised for building, which can be borrowed for thirty
years, and not in that raised for furniture, which can only be
borrowed for ten years. The additional twenty years for which
money can be borrowed for permanent buildings will be found to
make a very considerable difference in the annual repayments.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec131">131. Counters and Barriers.</h4>

<p><b>131. Counters and Barriers.</b>&mdash;Counters and barriers are required
chiefly in lending and reference libraries, or in situations
where it is necessary to cut readers off from books or
private rooms. No lending library counter which has to carry
an indicator should be more than thirty inches high and eighteen
inches wide, and for ledger or card charging and open access the
dimensions need not be more than thirty-two inches high and
two feet wide. Reference library counters for cutting readers
off from the books and for service should be thirty-two inches
high and two feet wide. All counters should be fitted on the
staff side with shelves and cupboards, and on the public side
the panelling should be raised at least four inches from the floor
to prevent it from being kicked and marked. It is a useful
plan to fit up the back of a long counter with shelves, drawers
and cupboards alternately, as shown in diagram on the next
page (<a href="#Fig23">Fig. 23</a>).</p>

<p>This arrangement can be carried out to any extent and in
any order, according to space. In lending library counters a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
slot for money should be made in the top of the counter over
one of the small locked drawers. This will form the till for
cash receipts from fines, the sale of catalogues, etc.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec132">132.</h4>

<p><b>132.</b> Barriers for open access lending and reference libraries
are made in various forms. In small open access libraries the
barriers need only be large enough to control the entrances and
exits of readers.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec133">133.</h4>

<p><b>133.</b> Lending library barriers for open access are planned in
a variety of ways to take charging trays, etc. The following
are typical illustrations of barriers or combined counters and
screens specially designed for open access libraries. The object
of the glazed screen is to protect the staff from draughts and
the charging system from being tampered with. The plans
and views of open access barriers in <a href="#Fig24">Figs. 24</a>-<a href="#Fig25">25</a> show the usual
arrangement for ordinary purposes, and an imaginary design
for a library doing a very large business requiring three assistants
at each side is shown in <a href="#Fig28">Fig. 28</a>. By means of this it would
be possible for six assistants, three at each side, to discharge and
charge books at the rate of 1400 per hour, a speed never required
anywhere.</p>

<p>For all practical purposes a barrier with two wickets on the
entrance side and one at the exit will serve for the largest single
library in existence (<a href="#Fig27">Fig. 27</a>). The treadle latches such as
are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
fitted in the open access libraries of Croydon, Clerkenwell,
Hornsey, Lambeth, Darwen, Southport, etc., will be found well
adapted for the purpose of controlling the wickets of both single
and double open access barriers (<a href="#Fig26">Fig. 29</a>).</p>

<div class="figc600" id="Fig26">
<img src="images/illo152.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="430" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 26.</span>&mdash;Lambeth (Herne Hill) Branch Library Open Access Barrier
(<a href="#Sec133">Section 133</a>).</p>
</div>

<p>The chief objection to wickets hinged at one side is their
tendency to slam, no matter what kind of controlling springs
or buffers are used. In course of time every form of pneumatic
or other spring loses its power, and some effective form of noiseless
turnstile or very light barrier on rising butts would perhaps
be an improvement. Where lending libraries are isolated, the
trouble is not so marked as in cases where they adjoin reading
rooms.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec134">134.</h4>

<p><b>134.</b> The plans already printed (<a href="#Fig18">Figs. 18</a>-<a href="#Fig22">22</a>) explain better
than words the form of counters best adapted for lending libraries
using the indicator system of issue.</p>

<p>The space for borrowers in front of an indicator ought not to
be less than four square feet per person likely to be present at
one time, in order to prevent crowding at busy times. Thus a
town with 3000 borrowers would have an average daily issue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
of about 300 volumes, which might mean seventy-five people
present at one time, counting companions, and thus 300 square
feet of borrowers&#8217; lobby would be necessary as a minimum; or
a space 30 by 10 feet. It is not often, however, that one finds
lobbies planned on this desirable scale. The height of a counter
designed to carry an indicator should not exceed thirty inches,
and the top need not be more than eighteen inches wide. The
length of the counter will depend entirely upon the kind of
indicator used, and whether it is classified or not, or intended
for all the stock or only for fiction. The indicators most used
all differ in size (see <a href="#Sec386">Section 386</a>, etc.), and this factor must be
taken into account in designing the counter.</p>

This may be either fixed or movable, and a good form can be
constructed of ornamental ironwork, surmounted by a polished
oak or walnut rail, about four to six inches wide, in the style of
illustration (<a href="#Fig30">Fig. 30</a>).</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec136">136. Screens.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>136. Screens.</b>&mdash;In small libraries with a small staff it is often
possible to obtain complete oversight of nearly every department
by using glazed partitions or screens instead of opaque
internal walls. In cases where there is no roof weight to be supported
this is a very good arrangement, and is recommended
for every building to which it can be applied. When such
partitions separate rooms, it is advisable to carry them right
up to the ceiling to exclude noise. In other situations, as when
dividing a room into two or more sections, the screens need not
be more than eight or nine feet high. Clear glass should be used
throughout, unless in the upper panels, for the sake of both
oversight and light.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec137">137. Lifts.</h4>

<p><b>137. Lifts.</b>&mdash;In large libraries with many floors, passenger or
other lifts for carrying heavy weights are desirable. In a building
with two or more floors, an ordinary lift for transporting
parcels of books to the extent of perhaps two hundredweights
should be provided in a convenient place, preferably against a
wall. Such lifts should have automatic brakes and simple
raising and lowering mechanism; but an electric motor will be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
found less noisy and easier to work than any form of rope lift.
In addition, it is often of greater service to have small, quick-running
lifts or tubes capable of carrying one to six single books
from floor to floor. In cases where lending library books are
issued for reading in the reading room, this is a very convenient
arrangement, and it also greatly facilitates the work of the staff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
by enabling messages and small articles to be rapidly transferred
from place to place.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec138">138. Speaking Tubes and Telephones.</h4>

<p><b>138. Speaking Tubes and Telephones.</b>&mdash;Speaking tubes connecting
every department should be provided in all new buildings,
if telephones have not already been fixed. The telephone is
much easier applied to an existing building, as there is less cutting
about of walls required. But in new buildings speaking tubes
can be provided quite easily, and they are simpler to work and
less liable to get out of order than telephones. The telephone
should be provided for every large public library, which ought
to be connected with the municipal offices, the telephone exchange
and its own branches. It is often possible for a public
library to obtain a sufficient service by having a wire from the
town hall switchboard to the library. The annual cost of this
is only about one-fourth of the regular exchange service. For
a complicated internal service of inter-communications, the
telephone is much superior to speaking tubes, as the switchboard
system enables the user to communicate with any department
without the need of extra tubes.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec139">139. Miscellaneous.</h4>

<p><b>139. Miscellaneous.</b>&mdash;In some libraries accommodation for
<span class="smcapall">CYCLES</span> is provided outside the buildings, which is the proper
place for such machines, in view of their tendency to do damage
when placed against interior walls. In buildings which front
busy main streets this kind of accommodation cannot be provided
unless there is a courtyard or similar space in front.
Some libraries which are infested by <span class="smcapall">DOGS</span> would be all the
better of some effective means of keeping such animals outside.
No doubt, if their owners were spoken to, they would agree to
fasten them to hooks or rails outside the building, if proper
means were provided.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec140">140.</h4>

<p><b>140.</b> <span class="smcap">Turnstiles</span> for counting purposes are fitted up in several
libraries, as well as in most museums, art galleries, etc. They
should be placed in situations where their noisy clacking will
not prove disturbing, if they are used at all.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec141">141.</h4>

<p><b>141.</b> Good English <span class="smcapall">CLOCKS</span>, with conspicuous dials, should
be placed in every public room of a library. Where a number
are provided, it is better to specify electrically controlled or
synchronized clocks, which keep uniform time and are much
less troublesome than ordinary self-wound clocks. Libraries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
should have a supply of small <span class="smcapall">THERMOMETERS</span> distributed and
fixed throughout the rooms as a check upon the internal
temperature, and it is a useful thing to provide a barometer
as well. Bold visible <span class="smcapall">CALENDARS</span> are also desirable in every
department.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="title">SHELVING AND ACCESSORIES</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec143">143.</h4>

<p><b>143.</b> The chief requirements of book-shelving are accessibility
and adjustability. All authorities on library architecture are
agreed that high shelves are an obstruction to quick service,
and a danger to books, by placing them in a vitiated atmosphere
with a comparatively high temperature. The old-fashioned wall-cases,
twelve or fifteen feet high, which could only be reached by
means of long ladders, are no longer recommended or installed,
because of the labour they place upon the staff, their danger,
and the fact that all the books on the upper shelves are not only
inaccessible, but liable to a certain amount of harm. Modern
librarians prefer to enlarge their floor area for the purpose of
book-storage, and to provide wall and standard bookcases which
are within easy reach of the floor, thus placing the entire stock
at the command of both staff and readers without the labour
or danger of climbing long ladders. It may be said, generally,
that high wall-shelves should never be provided, unless with the
provision of an iron gallery half-way up, which can be reached
by means of stairs.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec144">144.</h4>

<p><b>144.</b> The question of adjustability is just as important as
get-at-ability. In every method or appliance which is introduced
for library, or, indeed, any other work, the great principle
of movability or adjustability should be preferred to fixity. The
power of moving or changing without altering the character or
shape of anything is of enormous advantage in every operation,
and a very good illustration of the application of this power is
furnished by the card catalogue, with its infinite capacity for
expansion in every direction. Book-shelves should be as mobile
as cards in their own way, and should be so adjustable that a
new shelf can be introduced or an existing one removed at any
point where such a course is possible. The only advantage
which fixed wooden shelves possess is that of comparative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
cheapness, but this is an advantage which, in a short time, is
completely swallowed up in the inconveniences which arise
through the impossibility of placing books of varying sizes in
strict classified order on the shelves. Besides a great sacrifice
of vertical space in some places, it will be found in a rapidly
growing library that the carefully gauged shelves, at eight, nine,
ten, or twelve inches apart, in every tier, cannot be made to
contain all the books which ought to go on these shelves in their
order. The day comes when the eight-and-a-half or nine-and-a-half
inch book arrives which must go on the eight or nine inch
shelf, and, because there is no means of making a slight adjustment,
such books must either be shelved out of their order, or
placed on their fore-edges. If such shelves are arranged throughout
a library at a distance of ten inches apart to provide for
contingencies, they will take all sizes up to demy 8vo, but at a
great sacrifice of space, especially in the fiction shelves, where
most of the books average about seven and a half inches. Any
attempt at varying the distances between shelves in every tier
will lead to confusion in a strictly classified library. On the
other hand, liberal spacing will result in the loss of a shelf in
every tier, thereby reducing the total storage space by about
one-eighth or one-ninth, according to the number of shelves in
a tier. The balance of advantage lies, with movable forms of
shelving, and it is strongly recommended that no other kind be
specified or ordered.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec145">145.</h4>

<p><b>145.</b> The following diagrams give the usual dimensions for
ordinary standard and wall bookcases, and may be taken as
the unit from which a library stack can be built up according
to any plan of arrangement. <a href="#Fig31">Fig. 31</a> represents a double-sized
standard iron bookcase, 7 feet 6 inches &times; 3 feet 2 inches &times; 15
inches, which can be joined end to end to form cases of any
length, or used in halves to form cases against walls.</p>

<p>Exactly the same dimensions can be used with wooden
presses fitted with adjustable brackets or catches. In reference
libraries the dimensions may be slightly varied, as the average
book which must be stored is rather larger than in lending
libraries. But the chief provision for folio and large quarto
books should be in special cases arranged round the walls, and
it is well to have presses intended for music and quartos fitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
with uprights about eighteen inches apart, in order to distribute
the weight of the books and facilitate their handling.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec147">147. Adjustable Shelf Fittings.</h4>

<p><b>147. Adjustable Shelf Fittings.</b>&mdash;The old-fashioned varieties of
shelf adjustments for wooden bookcases, such as pegs fitting into
holes drilled in the uprights, one and a half
or two inches apart, wooden or metal ratchets
for carrying bars or rods for supporting the
shelves, and similar devices, may be dismissed
as unsuitable for modern library
purposes. The best-known adjustment is
that known as Tonks&#8217;, from the name of its
patentee. It consists of metal strips, with
perforations at inch intervals, let into
grooves in the uprights, and designed to
carry the shelves on four metal studs or
catches, which engage in the slots or perforations.
This method requires very careful
fitting, as the grooves in the woodwork
must be deep and smooth enough to admit
the catches, and each metal strip must be
accurately inserted so that the slots will come
level not only with those adjoining, but with
those on the opposite upright. The least
carelessness in fitting will cause shelves to
rock and buckle, because not supported by
catches all at one level. The illustration
on <a href="#Page_145">page 145</a> (<a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a>) will show exactly the
form of this fitting. It consists of: shelf
supported on standard; perforated metal slip
and stud; and groove in wooden standard.</p>

</div>

<p>It should be noted that this variety of shelf fitting does not
give absolute adjustability, but only a movement of about an
inch up or down, as may be required. Smaller adjustments
are impossible by this or any other similar system.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec148">148.</h4>

<p><b>148.</b> There are various other methods of fixed shelf adjustments
for wooden bookcases, English, American and German,
but none of them possess any particular advantage over Tonks&#8217;
variety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Absolute adjustability in shelf fittings, as applied to wooden
cases, has been obtained in the English method, to be seen at
various libraries in England. There are also various American
systems.</p>

<p>Both of these forms are similar in principle to the absolute
adjustments described under <a href="#Sec149">Section 149</a>, but the English system
was the first to be patented, and therefore ranks as the pioneer
of this type of shelf fitting.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec149">149. Metal Bookcases with Absolute Shelf Adjustments.</h4>

<p><b>149. Metal Bookcases with Absolute Shelf Adjustments.</b>&mdash;The
best and most used English variety of metal bookcase with
absolute shelf adjustment is that which has been installed in the
public libraries of Worcester, Shoreditch, Huddersfield, Lambeth,
Perth, the Patent Office Library, London, Islington and elsewhere.
It consists, as shown in <a href="#Fig31">Figs. 31</a>, <a href="#Fig34">34</a> and <a href="#Fig35">35</a>, of strong
steel uprights, in which are formed continuous grooves, which
carry and support shelf brackets designed to grip at any point
by automatic means. These brackets will slide up and down
the uprights to any point, while a small controlling lever is
depressed, but the moment this is released the bracket will
become firmly fixed in place, and will remain there till again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
moved, whatever weight may be placed upon the shelf which
it supports. These brackets can be pushed up without touching
the controlling lever, and will always grip at the point where
they are left. To push them down, the controlling arm must
be depressed as already described. The shelves for this type
of case may be either metal or wood, but probably good oak
shelves will be found as satisfactory as any. Standard cases
made in the dimensions given in <a href="#Sec145">Section 145</a> are usually divided
down the middle, at the back of each set of shelves, by means
of a wire-work grill. This does not obstruct oversight, light
or air, yet serves to prevent books on one face of the standard
from being accidentally or otherwise transferred to the opposite
face. There are points of safety, convenience and adjustability
about metal bookcases which make them preferable to all other
forms.</p>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>150.</b> A special form of this type of metal bookcase has been
designed for book-storage in small spaces, and as applied to the
India Office Library, London, and Bodleian Library, Oxford,
has been found convenient and economical. The same shelf
adjustment is used, but the presses instead of resting on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
floor are swung from iron girders, so as to slide easily whenever
wanted. These presses are swung closely side by side and
drawn out, one at a time, as required.</p>

<p>A somewhat similar plan for increasing the storage capacity
was introduced into the British Museum many years ago, the
chief difference being that the sliding presses go face to face
with the existing standards, one here and there, instead of in
solid rows as at the India Office.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec151">151.</h4>

<p><b>151.</b> It is not proposed to describe every variety of iron or
metal bookcase which has been introduced, such as the Library
Bureau, Smith, Lawrence, Cotgreave, etc., and it will be sufficient
to mention that in Britain, Germany and America there
are several interesting forms used.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec152">152. Special Bookcases.</h4>

<p><b>152. Special Bookcases.</b>&mdash;In <a href="#Sec146">Section 146</a> a form of special
wall-case is described which is suitable for storing folio and
quarto volumes. In very large libraries it may be necessary to
provide additional storage space for bound files of newspapers,
extra large folios and prints. Files of newspapers can be stored
in a special form of double rack, as illustrated in <a href="#Fig36">Fig. 36</a>.
As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
small libraries will bind only the files of local papers, the provision
by them of shelves for this purpose need not be a very
serious matter.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec153">153.</h4>

<p><b>153.</b> Large folio volumes are best kept flat on sliding trays
or shelves. When they are kept upright they are very apt to
suffer through the heavy leaves sagging and dragging at the
binding. Valuable folios should always be kept in flat positions.
A suitable method of storage is to provide a large double-sided
case, with a sloping top, which can be used for consulting the
books. The shelves should be arranged to slide out and in on
runners, and each shelf may have a brass handle on its fore-edge
to enable it to be easily pulled out. The dimensions of such a
case will depend upon the number of folios to be stored and
their size, but the following illustration (<a href="#Fig37">Fig. 37</a>) will be found
suitable for all ordinary purposes.</p>

<div class="figc600" id="Fig36">
<img src="images/illo165.png" alt="" width="600" height="225" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 36.</span>&mdash;Rack for Bound Newspapers (<a href="#Sec152">Section 152</a>).</p>
</div>

<p>This case will store about 150 to 200 folio volumes, according
to their thickness, which is ample space for all ordinary municipal
public libraries. The shelves of this case should be covered
on their upper surfaces with leather or thick cloth. A similar
style of rack can be used for storing large collections of prints,
the only difference being that the prints would be kept in special
boxes as described in <a href="#Sec307">Section 307</a>, which would take the place
of volumes.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec154">154.</h4>

<p><b>154.</b> In calculating the number of volumes which can be
shelved in a given space, the following general rules will be
found fairly accurate<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hind1_2">Nine lending library books will occupy one foot run of space.</p>

<p class="hind1_2">Eight reference library books will occupy one foot run of
space.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">Allowance must be made, in calculating from plans, for the
space occupied by uprights, etc., and care must be taken to
reckon dwarf bookcases only according to their capacity. If
nine inches are allowed as the average height of books, which
will give eight shelves to a tier seven feet six inches high, excluding
cornices, plinth or thickness of shelves, then a single-sided
case of the dimensions shown in <a href="#Sec146">Section 146</a> will store
216 volumes in a lending library and about 192 in a reference
library. A double-sided case will hold 432 and 384 volumes
respectively.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec155">155. Racks for Filing.</h4>

<p><b>155. Racks for Filing.</b>&mdash;Wooden racks or iron-pipe racks may
be used for a variety of purposes, such as storing unbound newspapers
and periodicals, pamphlets, and all kinds of loose papers
or bundles. Such racks are best made in a light, open form, so
as to reduce the collection of dust to a minimum, while admitting
air and light freely.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec156">156. Galleries.</h4>

<p><b>156. Galleries.</b>&mdash;Galleries of iron are sometimes added to
reference libraries and in other departments to provide a means
of reaching high wall-shelves, and also to give additional accommodation
for storage. They are a feature of the large stack
rooms of American libraries, wherein the books are all massed
together, gallery above gallery and tier above tier. Unless there
is some very strong reason, architectural or otherwise, galleries
should be avoided in every public library where rapid service<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
of readers is necessary. Save for storing little-used stock,
galleries are not recommended in any situation, unless the
pressure for book space is very great. When galleries must be
provided, care should be taken to provide adequate approaches.
If a straight staircase is out of the question, a circular iron one
should be provided, wide enough to enable an assistant to go
up or down comfortably with an armful of books. In some
libraries the circular iron staircases are more like exaggerated
corkscrews than proper means of getting up and down from a
gallery or floor. It is much better to have stairways in a single
flight, which will allow of two persons passing each other, and
for this purpose they ought to be at least three feet wide.</p>

<p>In libraries with bookcases of the uniform height of seven feet
six inches, long ladders will be unnecessary, but in cases where
they must be used, step ladders are preferable to rung ones. A
light form of step ladder which is used in many public libraries
and shops is illustrated (<a href="#Fig38">Fig. 38</a>). For all practical purposes
this ladder will be found ample.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec157">157.</h4>

<p><b>157.</b> In some open access libraries it has been found advisable,
in cases where the top shelves are out of reach, to provide a
continuous fixed step of wood or iron at the base of each bookcase,
to enable readers to reach the upper shelves without using
movable steps of the sort figured <a href="#Fig39">above</a>. A strong, wide iron
rail projecting about four inches or six inches from the case,
about nine inches or twelve inches above the ground, has been
found useful, especially when associated with a handle fastened
to the upright at a convenient height above. The illustration<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec158">158.</h4>

<p><b>158.</b> Detached steps secured to the uprights of bookcases,
combined with handles, are very often used for staff purposes
in place of the ordinary movable wooden steps or ladders. There
is one form with an automatic adjustment which enables the
step to spring up flat against the upright out of the way when
not wanted as figured in illustration (<a href="#Fig41">Fig. 41</a>). It is not
necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
to fit this into the uprights, and to cut away the woodwork
in order to let it into its place. There is still another variety,
used at Hull, Kilmarnock, etc., which is always in position for
use, but which also possesses an automatic adjustment enabling
it to be brushed aside harmlessly by anyone passing, and to
return to its &#8220;ready&#8221; position at once. This form can be
attached to any ordinary wooden upright by means of screws,
without cutting away or fitting. The handle supplied with this
has a superior shape and grip (<a href="#Fig42">Fig. 42</a>).</p>

<p><b>159.</b> The effect of shabby fittings and furniture on the minds
of visitors is not such as will tend to the promotion of discipline,
nor will it instil respect for the library into the minds of ratepayers
and readers. A fine building, appropriately fitted up,
will not only impress the average visitor, but it will cause the
citizens to take pride in the library as a civic institution. A
fine building shabbily fitted up inside will probably have quite
a different effect. While a strong distinction is to be drawn
between luxury and propriety in such matters, a much better
purpose will be served by procuring good and substantial fittings
and furniture than by wasting on extravagant exteriors most
of the money available for building.</p>

The rails of reading-room tables should not be made so deep as
to interfere with the comfort of persons using them, and cross
rails connecting the table legs near the floor level should never
be used, as these only serve as foot-rests. A certain number of
tables should be made with desk or sloping tops, as shown in
illustration (<a href="#Fig43">Fig. 43</a>). Oak, walnut or other hard woods should
be used for library furniture. Pitch pine is not recommended,
as it invariably splits as the resin dries out.</p>

<p><b>161.</b> In reference libraries, especially in those designed for
students with open access to the shelves, quite a liberal space
should be allowed. It has not hitherto been the practice, save
in large libraries like the British Museum, to give reference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
readers as much table room as is desirable, nor to give students
the amount of isolation which they require. The general policy
has been to seat readers at long tables and separate them from
their opposite neighbours by means of a screen, as is done at the
British Museum, and in libraries like the Cornell University,
Ithaca, New York. This method, which is depicted in <a href="#Fig44">Fig. 44</a>,
gives a certain amount of seclusion, but it does not provide a
sufficiency of room for books and materials. Then, of course,
no municipal library can hope to compete with the British
Museum in the provision of expensive furniture. To ensure
that each student reader will obtain a liberal share of room,
combined with comfort and isolation, a system of separate tables
in the form illustrated (<a href="#Fig45">Fig. 45</a>) is strongly recommended, or
some way which will secure the same accommodation. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
plan of making the table the unit of space instead of the readers
will automatically solve the problem of how much room to give

methods of displaying periodicals and magazines is discussed in
<a href="#Page_424">Chapter XXXI.</a>, and it is not necessary to consider the matter
of policy here. Various kinds of tables have been designed for
displaying magazines in covers in a fixed place, and for simply
enabling them to be easily read in the ordinary way. Where
periodicals are kept in racks, tables in the forms described in
<a href="#Sec160">Section 160</a> will be found sufficient. In cases where the tables
have to perform the combined function of racks and tables,
other arrangements are necessary. There are many forms of
rack-table, but only three need be described. The first, which
is used in several large libraries, provides a large elevated rack
above the table-top, on which the periodicals are placed, so as
to free as much as possible of the table surface for readers.
This is illustrated (<a href="#Fig46">Fig. 46</a>).</p>

chains encased in rubber or leathern thongs, and the contents

<p><b>164.</b> A remarkably effective form of periodical table, which
has a separate place and title for each, is shown in <a href="#Fig48">Fig. 48</a>.</p>

<p>This makes effective division between readers seated on
opposite sides of the table, and tends to prevent conversation
and the interchange of periodicals. The periodicals can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
fixed by means of chains or cords if thought necessary. At
Wolverhampton, Islington, Hammersmith, Croydon and other
places this plan of &#8220;tethering&#8221; magazines is adopted.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec165">165.</h4>

<p><b>165.</b> Periodical racks are made in a large variety of forms,
and the following illustrations are typical of most of the

<p><b>166. Reading Easels.</b>&mdash;In connexion with these special tables,
book-stands or easels for keeping a number of books open at once
will be found useful. It often happens that a student desires
to compare his authorities, and an easy means of keeping several
books open at a given place is necessary. The book easels shown
below are the best form yet devised. <a href="#Fig52">Fig. 52</a>, which is
made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
entirely of metal, has the advantage of leaving the table surface
practically free and unobstructed, while the automatic means
provided for keeping books open at any place, irrespective of
the number of leaves, is of great utility.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig53">Fig. 53</a>, constructed of wood, is also a light useful article, but
as it rests the book close to the table surface more obstruction
is caused, while the leaf-holders are not automatically adjusting.</p>

<p>There are various other forms of wooden reading easels, but
they are light articles designed to fold up, and will not carry
large reference books with any great degree of security.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec167">167. Chairs.</h4>

<p><b>167. Chairs.</b>&mdash;There is such an immense variety of
library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
chairs that the chief difficulty becomes that of selection. A
strong chair with a saddle seat fixed to a special rail instead of
direct to the legs is best, and in all ordinary situations arm-chairs
are preferable, as they give an automatic spacing of elbow-room
which renders calculation unnecessary. It is wise, however, to
avoid a very wide arm-chair, and to use small chairs only if
space is limited to two feet per reader.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec168">168.</h4>

<p><b>168.</b> Where the space between tables is very restricted the
chairs should be fastened to the floor, so that there can be no
blocking of gangways. One plan is that adopted at the Mitchell
Library, Glasgow, North Library, Fulham, and elsewhere, of
having revolving arm-chairs mounted on pedestals secured to
the floor. These have the one great disadvantage of being non-adjustable.
Readers cannot pull them a little forward or push
them back, and thus such fixed chairs have the defect of all
fixed things&mdash;they cannot be moved to suit varying conditions.
Another form for a crowded situation is a small strong chair of
good design anchored to the floor by means of a stout cord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
(<a href="#Fig54">Fig. 54</a>). Each chair has a stout staple screwed under the seat
in the centre, and a similar staple is screwed into the floor at a
suitable distance from the table front, and corresponding in
situation with the staple in the chair seat when placed in position.
Lengths of stout window cord are then cut and provided with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
swivel hooks at either end, which are fastened to the staples on
the floor and on the seat, allowing a sufficient length of cord to
admit of a fair amount of play and movement when anchored.
On granolithic or other cement or concrete floors, fixed chairs
cannot be used readily.</p>

<p>This kind of anchorage allows of a chair being moved backwards,
forwards or sideways, and readers can get to and from
their seats without trouble. Arm-chairs
are not recommended for this
style of fastening.</p>

<p>All kinds of chairs should be shod
with rubber or leather pads to deaden
the noise of movement on the floor.
There are several varieties of such
pads to be obtained from furnishing
firms.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec169">169.</h4>

<p><b>169.</b> Hat rails of metal or wood are
sometimes provided under all chairs&mdash;a
very necessary provision in wet
weather. The Continental system of
uncovering the head when entering
public buildings is not yet very common
in the United Kingdom, but
readers should certainly be encouraged
to do so by having the
means of bestowing their headgear placed easily at hand.
General hat, coat and umbrella stands or racks are not popular
in public libraries, and need not, as a rule, be provided. But
some kind of hat and umbrella holders should certainly be provided
in connexion with the chairs. A very good combination
arm-chair is shown in the accompanying illustration (<a href="#Fig55">Fig. 55</a>).
This provides hat and umbrella accommodation, and may also
have attached to the left, or both arms, a folding wire-work drop
holder, in which to place completed papers, light books or other
articles not wanted to litter the table-top (<a href="#Fig56">Fig. 56</a>). Of course,
such chairs with these additional accessories could only be used
in situations where there was plenty of room. In many cases
umbrella rails are attached to every table, and this is usually
the best plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec170">170.</h4>

<p><b>170.</b> Every library should buy more chairs than are required.
This will enable the chairs to be removed for cleaning purposes
in batches of a dozen or more, their places being taken by the
spare ones. This will prevent the seating accommodation from
being reduced during any cleaning operations.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec171">171. Desks.</h4>

<p><b>171. Desks.</b>&mdash;For staff purposes ordinary school desks will
be found ample. These are provided with side flaps and a
locking compartment. A Canadian form with shelves and a
lock-up desk flap, with pigeon holes, suitable for going against
a wall, is a useful type of desk for assistants doing a special class
of work, as the desk flap can be locked back out of the way,
and so protect the papers or work.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec172">172.</h4>

<p><b>172.</b> For large libraries, where an elevated superintendent&#8217;s
desk is necessary, the combined desk and drawer cabinet used
in the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, has many advantages.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec173">173. Lecture Room.</h4>

<p><b>173. Lecture Room.</b>&mdash;Furniture and fittings for children&#8217;s
departments and lecture rooms require special consideration.
The former are dealt with in <a href="#Page_439">Division XIII.</a> In the lecture room
the principal fittings are the platform and the fittings connected
with the use of the lantern. Platforms should be wide, and should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
be as long as it is possible to make them having regard to
economy of space in the room. A height of three feet is suitable,
and the structure should be solid, so that it may not echo
or squeak beneath the tread, and a covering of some sound-deadening
material&mdash;thick cork-lino or cocoanut-matting&mdash;is
desirable. A counter or fixed table running along the front has
been found useful, and to this water, gas, and similar fittings
may be connected for use in science lectures; but this counter
is not usually required, and it may obstruct the screen and will
certainly prevent the use of the platform for dramatic and
similar representations for which a clear stage is necessary.
Green baize hangings as a background and front curtains of this
material are very effective for several purposes. The platform
should so be placed that it can be reached by the lecturers
without the necessity of passing through the audience.</p>

<p>For lantern screen there is nothing better than a smooth wall
finished off in flat white, but where this is impossible a rigid
is preferable to a rolling screen as giving a surface free from folds
and kinks. Screens should be kept perfectly clean, as dirt injures
the effect of slides incalculably. The lantern itself should
be of the electric arc variety, as being easy to manage and always
ready with little delay, especially where the &#8220;direct&#8221; electric
current is available. It is best installed in a room outside, or
a gallery closed in from, the lecture room, the projection being
made through an opening. An electric signal which provides
at the platform a push for the use of the lecturer, and sounds
a &#8220;buzzer&#8221; or flashes a small lamp in the operator&#8217;s apartment,
is probably the best form of lantern signal.</p>

<p>The chairs in lecture rooms should be as comfortable as means
will allow, and should be fitted with rubber tips to ensure quiet.
Quiet floor coverings should be used in the room, and, indeed, all
fittings and furniture should produce that ease of body which
will allow the mind to occupy itself exclusively with what is
going on upon the platform.</p>

<h2>DIVISION VI<br />
BOOK SELECTION AND ACCESSION</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="title">BOOK SELECTION</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec174">174. General Principles.</h4>

<p><b>174. General Principles.</b>&mdash;Although a great number of articles
and papers have been written upon the subject of book selection,
there still seems room for some remarks upon the general question
from a standpoint somewhat different from the ordinary. Most
of the articles which have come under notice deal with the mere
routine of book selection&mdash;how to systematize the ordering of
books; the work connected with preparing them for public use;
the bibliographical side; the question of duplicating popular
books; and other more or less mechanical aspects of the matter.
The philosophy of book selection and questions connected with
the policy of building up libraries have rarely been considered.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec175">175.</h4>

<p><b>175.</b> The first point which occurs is the connexion between
a library&#8217;s income and its book-purchasing power. As, by law
established, most British library incomes are strictly limited, it
follows that a similar limitation must govern the supply of
books, and that only a <i>selection</i> of new books can be procured,
old and out-of-print books taking their chance. The very
largest rate-supported libraries are bound by this limitation to
buy only a selection from the immense mass of books annually
published, and, even if such purchases amount to several thousands
of volumes, they represent only a <i>selection</i>. The smaller
libraries must of necessity make a selection within a selection,
and it follows that, in all cases of libraries supported by small
incomes or burdened by heavy charges for the repayment of
loans or other purposes, the selection must be carefully made if
it is to be representative of all that is best in ancient and modern
literature. Another factor which enters into the matter need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
only be mentioned in order to be dismissed: that is the obvious
unsuitability of a very large proportion of the books annually
published because of their form (pamphlets and tracts), subject-matter
(school-books, bibles, etc.), or special nature (local lists,
reissues, directories, etc.).</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec176">176.</h4>

<p><b>176.</b> The fund available in most public libraries for the purchase
of books can be made the basis for a rough calculation
showing at what rate libraries of different sizes should grow.
By reference to the tables in <a href="#Sec31">Section 31</a> it will be found that
the sum which can be annually expended on books is limited in
libraries of all sizes, and that the annual additions must of
necessity follow the same limitation.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec177">177.</h4>

<p><b>177.</b> The annual production of new publications in the United
Kingdom may be taken at about 10,620 volumes, including
everything, and the number of new books in this total may be
averaged at about 8300 volumes. It will thus be seen that the
British municipal libraries must be <i>selectors</i> rather than <i>collectors</i>
of books, because the income of no one of them is equal to buying
more than a proportion of the 8300 new books published
annually in Britain alone. Some English public libraries, because
of their accumulations of old, useless and effete books, resemble
gardens choked with weeds; and their efficiency is clogged by
the necessity for storing and caring for books which are of no
value or interest. The presence of such books in a modern library
hinders effective use and administration, because they occupy
space urgently wanted for more useful modern books; they add
enormously to the cost of cataloguing and charging; and in
other ways they use up the resources of the library without
adding to its public utility.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec178">178.</h4>

<p><b>178.</b> It may be taken as a somewhat strong statement, that
there are not more than 50,000 books, excluding duplicates of
popular works and those in more than one volume, worthy of
preservation in any public municipal library. The truth is that,
of real, living works of literary and human interest, there are
perhaps not more than 20,000 in the English language, but the
larger figure is preferred in order to cover the world&#8217;s literary
output fully. Let anyone who doubts this try to compile a list
of even 5000 books of permanent literary or other interest, in
order to find what a difficult task it is. No doubt the difficulty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
of selection is the main reason why some public libraries grow
up in a haphazard way, because it is a work which demands not
only persevering industry, but an encyclop&aelig;dic knowledge of
literature and the contents of books. Nevertheless, this difficulty
of selection, and the limitation of the field of selection, are
powerful reasons why municipal libraries should abandon the
museum or storage ideal, and go boldly for making the workshop
or practical utility ideal the one most worthy of realization.
In <a href="#Page_106">Chapter VIII.</a> it has already been pointed out to what extent
British libraries have fostered indiscriminate collecting, often at
the expense of efficiency, while the workshop plan of library has
been comparatively neglected. Even if municipal libraries had
unlimited resources, the wisdom of indiscriminate collecting would
be doubtful; especially as many special libraries are doing the
work. Specialization should be the watchword of the future,
owing to the enormous literary activity of recent times, and the
branch of specialization which public libraries should adopt is
careful <i>selection</i> of books and equally careful <i>rejection</i> of all
which have outlived their day and purpose, or become &#8220;dull,
stale and unprofitable.&#8221; Public library buildings should be
erected, not on the principle of storing as many books as can
possibly be collected in fifty years&#8217; time, but of restricting the
book accommodation to the reasonable limits which careful
selection and cautious discarding will fix, and increasing the space
available for readers, and giving them only the very best literature,
imaginative or instructive, that the world has to offer.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec179">179.</h4>

<p><b>179.</b> It is a hazardous undertaking to lay down any particular
rules for the formation of a British municipal library, and especially
to state what proportions each class of literature should
assume. Equally futile is it to take any figure as the average
price which each volume in a library should cost. Although
4s. 5d. has been adopted as an average price, this must only be
regarded as a mere basis for a calculation which simply aims at
being a suggestion. Practically every public library differs in
its needs according to its income and the special industries and
character of the people in the town where it is situated.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec180">180.</h4>

<p><b>180.</b> Attempts have been made at various times by different
authorities to lay down the proportions of every class of literature
which should be represented in public libraries. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>

<p>There are one or two changes which modern practice will make
probable in these percentages, such as increases in the percentages
of classes 5-7 and a decrease in class 8. The attention now
bestowed upon technical education and the universal provision
of music texts will almost inevitably increase these classes at
the expense of some other classes.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec181">181.</h4>

<p><b>181.</b> Imaginative literature rightly takes first place in the
representation of classes, and when made up of Prose Fiction,
Poetry, Music and Painting, accounts for about 33 per cent.
of the whole. Although Bacon in his classification of human
knowledge places Imagination as represented by Poetry at the
end of his scheme, thereby, perhaps, indicating his opinion of its
comparative importance, there can be no doubt that as regards
popularity, importance and longevity it easily maintains first
place in the minds and hearts of a majority of the human race.
Whose are the great names in literature? The philosophers,
or historians, or scientists? None of these. The story-teller,
the song-writer, the singer and the artist completely overshadow
all other kinds of literary and scientific genius, and monopolize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
a foremost position of honour among mankind, because, after
all, they are the greatest teachers as well as the most capable
entertainers. Homer, Dante, Shakespeare, Goethe, Cervantes,
Moli&egrave;re, Balzac, Hugo, Scott, Dickens, Fielding, Thackeray,
Burns, Byron, Milton, Beethoven, Handel, Wagner, Titian,
Raphael, Turner, Rembrandt, and so on in endless variety, are
infinitely greater and more treasured names to thousands of
human beings than any of the exponents of more formal and
exact knowledge. The story-teller and the singer will be remembered
long after philosophies, and systems of history and science
are as mouldering and forgotten as the ruins of ancient Babylon.
The great majority of the people of all nations will much rather
sing with the singers than chop logic with the philosophers, and
this is at once a reason and justification for imaginative literature
occupying the leading place in all public libraries. It has
become the fashion for a certain section of librarians, a few
public men and a considerable number of newspapers, to lament
in doleful accents the popularity and preponderance of fiction
reading in all kinds of lending libraries. But surely Fiction, as
the most hardy and flourishing form of literary endeavour,
which has been built up by the contributions of some of the
greatest minds of all nations, cannot be denied its rightful place
because certain narrow-minded persons think it fashionable to
denounce the whole policy of public libraries? Whether they
choose to do so or not matters very little, since it is quite evident
that imaginative literature is going to survive, whatever
happens, as it has done with extraordinary strength and vitality,
through ages of change and destruction; while philosophical,
political and social systems have appeared and disappeared in
endless procession. This is a reason why imaginative literature
should occupy a foremost place in public libraries, and the theory
of the survival of the fittest is amply proved by the vitality of
prose fiction, poetry and music, which entitles them to receive
the attention due to their importance in the regard of mankind.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec182">182. Best Books.</h4>

<p><b>182. Best Books.</b>&mdash;A live library, in addition to the literary
classics in all departments, should only select the best and most
popular books. The question of selecting only the very best,
or only what is in great demand, should be compromised by
always getting the best, with a selection of the most popular,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
subject to the understanding that the latter are to be discarded
when their day is past. Every movement which stirs the public
mind and imagination produces a great crop of books, but only
a very small proportion of these survive or are worthy of preservation.
No one can argue against a moderate supply of such
works at the time when public interest is aroused, but objection
may be raised to the more ephemeral books of this kind being
preserved long after all interest in their subjects has waned. If
a municipal library founded in 1750, and steadily collecting for
156 years, could be found, its contents would be composed of
enormous quantities of dead and forgotten theology, history,
biography, science, fiction and every other class, which would
not excite the slightest interest in the minds of five persons in
a thousand. The skimmings of such a library would no doubt
be valuable, and a fair proportion of it of interest and use to
present-day readers, but the bulk of it would be of no practical
service to anyone.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec183">183.</h4>

<p><b>183.</b> The general public is comparatively indifferent to bibliographical
rarities, and books which are merely curious or scarce
should not be bought from the present restricted funds of British
municipal libraries. There is a certain advantage in making a
small special collection, on the museum plan, to trace and illustrate
the evolution and history of printing and book production
from the original manuscript forms, but the general connection
of incunabula and rare specimens of typography by modern
municipal libraries is neither possible nor desirable. There is
infinitely more wisdom in spending &pound;50 in a selection of modern
works on technical subjects, which would be of immense service
to living persons, than in spending the same amount in the purchase
of a single rare Bible which will only appeal to a few
students of typography. Books must not be regarded as an
investment on which a profit can be made by a sale at some
future date, because books of bibliographical rarity and much
monetary value bought from public funds must remain public
property, inalienable for all time. The books bought for a public
library should rather be regarded as machinery or plant, to be
renewed when necessary and kept thoroughly abreast of the
times.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec184">184.</h4>

<p><b>184.</b> Returning to the question of buying and preserving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
books of temporary interest. There are hundreds of subjects
which in their day have excited great public interest, and in
connexion with which an enormous literature exists, but which
have faded into comparative insignificance with the lapse of
time. Take subjects like the Jacobite Rebellions, French
Revolution, American Civil War, the Slavery controversy,
Crimean War or Disruption of the Church of Scotland. Every
one of these subjects was represented in its day by cart-loads
of books and pamphlets, but the whole of these have been sifted
and epitomized by later historians in works of permanent value,
and municipal libraries can simply buy these, and leave the preservation
of the contemporary literature, which ranks as original
authorities, to the care of the special libraries which exist for
the purpose. The literature of the Boer War is a case in point,
as also is much of the literature of the Great European War of
1914-1919 already. It is necessary for public libraries, while
public interest is keen, to select the best, or what may seem best,
from the mass of material pouring from the press, but presently
all this will be condensed into a few classics, giving in a comprehensive
and sufficient manner every fact of the slightest
interest to posterity, and then all the ephemeral works can be
discarded in their favour. What remains of any particular
interest to students, or even ordinary readers, from the huge
literature which arose from the Crimean War? Only Kinglake
and perhaps two popular illustrated books. The same holds
good with all subjects which have created immense contemporary
literatures, and there need not be the slightest compunction
about discarding any book when its usefulness is past unless
it takes rank as a valuable original authority. At a later stage
some suggestions on book discarding or library weeding are given,
which may prove helpful.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec185">185.</h4>

<p><b>185.</b> Book selection should be conducted upon the sound
principle of buying only the best representative works on all
subjects, whatever may be their cost or place of origin. A more
haphazard and ineffectual method of building up a public library
than buying cheap series and libraries of reprints can hardly be
imagined. It is almost equivalent to advising a committee to
buy cheap books by the yard in order to fill the shelves, and let
the proper representation of great subjects depend on chance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
Books published in &#8220;series&#8221; or &#8220;libraries&#8221; are too often mere
commercial ventures of small literary or other value; and in
the case of editions of standard authors, such uniform series are
often the worst form in which a poet or novelist can be presented
to a reader. They are full of errors and omissions, and whether
the series is devoted to art, science, literature or history, it may
be taken for granted that they are simply temporary text-books
which possess the doubtful advantage of being bound uniformly,
and the undoubted disadvantage of being often uniformly
erroneous and misleading. Of course this statement does not
apply all round, because there are several well-known series of
works of quite exceptional value. Connected with this a word
may be permitted on the nationality of text-books. Patriotism
in literature and library management may be a fine thing, but
it must occasionally lead to sorry results in a public library.
The best and most recent scientific works, whether on biology,
geology or any other subject, should be bought without regard
to the nationality of the authors.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec186">186. Popular Books.</h4>

<p><b>186. Popular Books.</b>&mdash;The duplication of popular or temporarily
popular books is a policy to be adopted with the greatest
of care. In some libraries the plan of multiplying copies of
every book which becomes fashionable is carried to such an
extreme that some injury must be done to the general work of
the library by unduly fostering one class of literature at the
expense of all the other classes. The practice of adding six or
more copies of a new novel has the effect of decreasing the funds
available for the purpose of buying other works, and it certainly
gives rise to misleading conceptions of the stock of books possessed
by the libraries. A reported stock of 5000 novels may
easily mean an actual stock of only 3000 different works in
libraries which buy three, six or twelve copies of a single popular
work. This makes a vast difference in the field of choice offered
to borrowers, because, after all, popular novels of the ordinary
much-advertised class soon have their little day, and the duplicates
become dead stock. For this reason caution should be
exercised in the supply of extra copies of temporarily popular
books, and a good plan is to provide a special stock or accessions
book in which they can be registered and, when necessary,
written off without complicating the other records of the library.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
These remarks apply almost exclusively to the duplication of
novels and magazines. There is less need to trouble about other
classes.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec187">187. Replacements and Out-of-print Books.</h4>

<p><b>187. Replacements and Out-of-print Books.</b>&mdash;Replacement of
worn-out books is a recurrent, necessary and serious expense
in most libraries, and one which gravely reduces possible expenditure
upon new books. Before replacing an old, dirty or
defective book it should be carefully considered if it is worth
retaining in the library. Closely connected with the question
of replacements is the matter of out-of-print books.</p>

<p>Most librarians in libraries of several years&#8217; standing have
been confronted with the difficulty of obtaining copies of certain
books which have been allowed to go out of print by their
publishers. The number of such books is rapidly increasing,
and among them are works which have taken a recognized place
in English literature, as well as many others which have obtained
a certain value by being enshrined in the catalogues of hundreds
of public and other libraries. In course of time many of these
books are worn out, and it becomes necessary to replace them
with new copies. It is then the discovery is made that fresh
copies cannot be obtained, and the librarian receives a long list
of books from his bookseller marked with the ominous sign
&#8220;O/P.&#8221; A temporary relief is sometimes obtained by advertising
for second-hand copies. Even these are becoming more
difficult to procure, and in the case of novelists like G. P. R.
James, James Grant and Harrison Ainsworth, sometimes only
three-volume editions are reported.</p>

<p>It is not suggested that all out-of-print books should be reprinted,
nor do we suggest that the fact that a book has appeared
in many library catalogues is conclusive evidence of its permanence;
but there are certainly numbers of books which are
frequently mentioned in other books, or in the newspapers, which
have been allowed to run out of print; and the combined efforts
of librarians might induce publishers to republish these. Usually
speaking, however, the fact that a book has remained out of
print for more than a year or two is evidence of the absence of
public demand for it, and seeing that novel-writing is probably
at a higher general level now than at any earlier period (in spite
of the lack of individual Fieldings or Jane Austens), we are of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
opinion that such out-of-print books may be withdrawn from
the library records, and the gaps left made good by more modern
works of equal merit and greater popularity. After all, and
especially so far as imaginative literature is concerned&mdash;and
these remarks apply almost exclusively to that&mdash;it is no part
of the work of the library to revive what public opinion, the
soundest <i>ultimate</i> guide, has permitted to perish; more especially
as booksellers charge exaggerated prices for out-of-print
novels, whatever their merit may be. In the case of some of
the older books which form landmarks in literary history, it
is absolutely necessary to have well-edited modern reprints for
the benefit of the students who are being formed in every
school in the kingdom.</p>

<p>Books which are purchased to replace worn-out copies need
not receive new numbers, but may be given the numbers of the
books which they replace.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec188">188. Doubtful Books.</h4>

<p><b>188. Doubtful Books.</b>&mdash;Censorship on books admitted into
public libraries has been exercised much more frequently and
rigorously in the United States than in the United Kingdom.
Instances are common in both countries of books being excluded
for sectarian or political reasons by Public Library Committees.
Any action of this kind on the part of a Public Library Committee
should be confined to protecting junior readers from
coming into contact with demoralizing literature, and preventing
the library from becoming a dumping-ground for feeble and
trashy books of all kinds. No one can object to a committee
electing to sit in judgment on any book which may be thought
to endanger public decency, or inculcate ideas of morality counter
to those generally adopted, but such explorations in search of
the improper should not be confined to fiction. The question
of buying certain <i>free</i> classics, such as Rabelais and Boccaccio,
is quite another matter. All libraries ought to possess them,
provided reasonable means are taken to keep them out of the
hands of the immature reader. As regards what constitutes
maturity, every library authority will doubtless frame its own
rules.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec189">189. Reference and Lending Books.</h4>

<p><b>189. Reference and Lending Books.</b>&mdash;A difficulty is sometimes
experienced in deciding for which department books of a certain
class are most suitable. About such quick-reference works as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
encyclop&aelig;dias, dictionaries, annuals, directories, atlases, large
art works, etc., there can be very little doubt, but expensive
scientific books, large works of travel, theological and historical
works of a certain kind offer a problem much more complicated.
As reference libraries are at present constituted and used in many
English towns, the plan of putting all expensive books of whatever
nature in the reference department simply means that they
are seldom used, and might as well not have been bought. In
properly conducted open access reference libraries, which are
liberally and intelligently conducted, a good deal may be said in
favour of placing such books there. They will at least be freely
accessible without the formality of readers having to make
written application, while the advantage of a reference book being
always on the premises is not to be overlooked. No harm can
result from placing all kinds of expensive text-books in the
lending department, and if they are not on loan they are always
available for the use of any reference reader who wants them.
The advantage to a student of being able to take a recondite
and expensive text-book home with him for comparison with,
and as an aid to, his own books is undeniable, and it is the fact
that, by co-operation, the citizens of a town can thus procure
otherwise unattainable books, which makes the Public Libraries
Acts so valuable, and adds force to the plea for placing expensive
works within easy reach of the majority of readers. Local circumstances
will in most cases modify the conditions under which
reference and lending libraries are built up and differentiated.
In some places there is no separation, save in the catalogue,
between the reference and lending libraries, and in others
both departments are not only kept apart, but subdivided
into open, special and store collections. All this is very
much a matter of administration to be settled by each
responsible officer in accordance with his or her knowledge
of the particular local conditions. We deal with this question
more in detail in the chapters on the Reference Library
(<a href="#Page_375">Division XII.</a>).</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec190">190. Special Collections.</h4>

<p><b>190. Special Collections.</b>&mdash;The most necessary work of the
library, after it has formed its general collection, is to collect local
literature; this we deal with in a separate chapter (<a href="#Page_399">XXVIII.</a>).
Most public libraries possess some kind of special collection in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
addition to the purely local collection. Examples of these may
be specified in the Shakespeare and Cervantes collections at
Birmingham; the Burns and Scottish poetry collections at
Glasgow; music, shorthand, Chinese books, etc., at Manchester;
fishes at Cheltenham; Welsh literature at Cardiff, etc. The
literature of special local industries should always be collected.
Representative works in foreign languages, particularly French,
German and Italian, should also be collected, in addition to the
Greek and Latin classics; and the large and more cosmopolitan
cities may endeavour to represent every foreign literary output
so far as their circumstances warrant and their finances permit
them to do so.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec191">191. Sets of Periodicals.</h4>

<p><b>191. Sets of Periodicals.</b>&mdash;Some discrimination must be made
in regard to the collecting of periodicals. Larger libraries settle
the question by securing and preserving sets of all magazines of
value which they can accommodate; but obviously the expense
of the practice, the ephemeral character of much of this type of
literature, and the large amount of shelf space it requires, makes
that practice impossible for any but the largest libraries.
Ephemeral, but otherwise wholesome, magazines may be used
unbound for issue in lending libraries to good purpose; or may
be bound and so used&mdash;but not replaced when they are worn
out. Only periodicals which have a <i>reference</i> value should be
retained in sets, and then only where the geographical situation
of the library warrants that course. A smaller town near a
great town library may reasonably refer its readers to that library
for sets of expensive periodicals. We are led to this view by the
facilities now at the disposal of librarians through the Library
Association. That body now publishes the <i>Subject Index to
Periodicals</i>, hitherto called <i>The Athen&aelig;um Subject Index</i>&mdash;an
invaluable and indeed indispensable tool for all librarians&mdash;and
by an arrangement with the Central Lending Library for
Students, Tavistock Square, London, W.C., any article recorded
in the <i>Subject Index</i> may be borrowed for a payment of
about fourpence. The <i>Index</i>, moreover, gives a list of the
principal periodicals, and is a rough guide to assessing their
permanent worth as well as an admirable key to their
contents.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec192">192. Music</h4>

<p><b>192. Music</b>.&mdash;Nearly every public library of any
importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
has now established a music collection, and the general experience
is that it is one of the most popular and appreciated sections
in the library. The provision should not at first extend to more
than collections of pianoforte, violin, organ and vocal music in
the form of bound volumes; operas, oratorios, cantatas and
other vocal scores; the scores of orchestral and chamber compositions;
and text-books on theory, history and various instruments.
Single compositions in sheet form should be very
sparingly introduced, if at all, unless collections of the songs of
some of the best modern composers are formed and bound up
into volumes. A large stock of compositions in single sheets,
however bound or secured, would prove a great trouble in a
public library. The compositions of local composers should be
collected, however, and bound in volumes. In providing shelving
for music, it is well to have special cases with uprights only
eighteen inches apart, as it is very difficult to consult long rows
of thin quarto books, when on shelves three feet long, owing to
the weight of the books. This applies to quarto and folio books
generally.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec193">193. Engravings.</h4>

<p><b>193. Engravings.</b>&mdash;Save in book form, very few public libraries
have done much in the way of collecting engravings, prints and
etchings, unless they have been of local interest. Considerations
of expense would deter most British public libraries from
attempting this kind of collection, and it is rather a pity, because
many prints and engravings which illustrate historical events
have immense practical value. Portraits, too, are extremely
valuable and useful, but as means are at present provided, the
whole matter is one of pure speculation and sentiment. But
perhaps the day will come when public libraries may be able
to collect specimens of the etched work of great artists; engravings
after the greatest masters; engravings and prints depicting
leading events in the national history; and pictures illustrating
costume, ceremonials, manners and customs, disappearing
buildings, great engineering works, topographical changes, etc.
The value of these graphic aids to the furtherance of knowledge
is enormous, and it is a pity some systematic effort cannot be
made to record, preserve and index them more generally and
effectively than has been done in depositories like the British
Museum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec194">194. Photographs.</h4>

<p><b>194. Photographs.</b><a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>&mdash;Collections
of photographs which deal
with local matters should be made by every public library (see
<a href="#Page_399">Chapter XXVIII.</a>). Certain American libraries also collect
photographs of great pictures and those which represent various
natural forms. Studies for the use of artists are also collected,
mounted on cards, and made accessible, and some of these
attempts to popularize art should be made in British libraries.
Photographs are comparatively cheap, and almost every kind
of picture and study can be obtained in this medium. What is
particularly required is some kind of practical list or guide,
drawn up by an expert, from which libraries could make their
selections. A systematic list covering the various arts of design,
historical painting, sculpture, architecture, etc., would be of
great service. Photographs of great public events, ceremonials,
buildings, etc., and of eminent personages, would have to be
purchased according to means, and, as every one knows, this
might be made an endless matter. There is no reason, however,
why public libraries should not preserve good photographs of
the most eminent authors, artists, musicians, scientists, military
commanders, royal personages, etc. Portraits of such persons
are not always easy to find in books, when required, especially
as the <i>A. L. A. Portrait-Index</i> is limited in scope; therefore a
separate collection of portraits in alphabetical order would be
a valuable addition to a public library. In this connexion it
is useful to remove portraits of celebrities, views, etc., from
worn-out books and magazines, and preserve them along with
all other appropriate matter.</p>

Lantern Slides.</b><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>&mdash;In
libraries which possess lecture-rooms
or other suitable accommodation, it is often desirable to collect
lantern slides on such subjects as local topography and history,
or on topics which illustrate bibliographical and kindred subjects.
These will be found very useful, and as the collection
increases, sets can be lent out to societies or individuals who
require them for lectures. The cost of storing and cataloguing
the slides is not great, and they are undoubtedly a valuable
addition to the pictorial side of literature.</p>

Trade and other Catalogues.</b><a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>&mdash;A
most useful department,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
though somewhat difficult to maintain, is a collection of the
best and most representative catalogues and price lists of all
kinds of commodities. Several points crop up in connection
with the work of forming such collections, and the question of
policy is here perhaps the most important. Many firms will not
give their price lists; and it may be considered invidious to
select firms, thereby suggesting favouritism and unfair advertising.
In some industries prices, ideas and designs are regarded
as trade secrets, and doubtless jealousies might be stirred up in
some quarters. But the fact remains that illustrated catalogues
of books, furniture, ironmongery, machinery, pottery, art publications,
scientific apparatus, etc., are often more generally useful
than text-books or special trade and professional journals.
Even pattern books of wall-papers, bookbinders&#8217; cloths, leather-work,
typefounding and so forth are of immense service to
special students, and an effort should be made to strengthen
the literary side of suitable subjects by a judicious selection of
the best illustrated trade catalogues.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec197">197. Books for the Blind.</h4>

<p><b>197. Books for the Blind.</b>&mdash;Many libraries now store and
circulate books for the blind in the Braille and Moon types, and
in this work some of them have been aided by the expert advice
and actual donations of special societies interested in the well-being
of the blind. There is quite an extensive and rapidly
growing literature for the blind in the special raised type required
for finger-reading, and a library of a few hundreds of volumes
makes quite an imposing show. The question of space will
arise in many places, because books for the blind are, as a rule,
only embossed on one side of each page, and, owing to this
embossing and the size of the type, some books make several
thick quarto volumes. No space could, however, be devoted to a
more humane or valuable purpose than the storage of books for the
blind, and every encouragement and support should be given to
the movement; though it would undoubtedly be the most effective
method of ministering to the needs of the locality to subscribe
for a constantly changing supply of books to one of the institutions
for the blind which make a speciality of this kind of work.</p>

<p><b>199. Discarding Effete Books.</b>&mdash;The question of periodically
weeding out a public library, with the object of keeping it always
up to date and also making room for fresh additional stock, has
already been partly discussed in <a href="#Sec107">Sections 107</a>, etc., and <a href="#Sec174">174</a>, etc.,
and it is a most important part of modern public library policy.
The periodical reprinting of class lists affords a valuable opportunity
for considering the claims of certain kinds of books to
remain idle on the shelves, where they not only fill the space
which should be available for more live works, but they obstruct
the general work of the library. Every public library receives
at one time or another books which must for reasons of policy
be catalogued. Such books, for example, as are donated, are
expected to be placed in the library and duly catalogued. There
are generally hundreds of such books in every large library which
have no permanent value; and these, and also the mistaken
selections of committees and librarians, should be discarded as
soon as possible. There are also, of course, the books which
go out of use automatically, such as those noted in the subjoined
<a href="#Sec200">Rules</a>, and those others which manage to slip into libraries
when the custodian is dreaming of higher things, or is misled
by the erroneous titles adopted by authors. The weeding-out
process should be continuous, and when catalogues are being
reprinted, the books are being rearranged, or any kind of fresh
movement is being made, a specially favourable opportunity is
afforded to prune the growth of weeds which will somehow
manage to infest the best-regulated libraries in spite of every
care. The sentimental museum idea is, of course, responsible
for much of the tendency to collect and preserve everything, on
the Byronic theory, no doubt, that</p>

<p class="center fsize80 nowrap blankbefore">A book&#8217;s a book, although there&#8217;s nothing in&#8217;t,</p>

<p class="hind0_2 blankbefore"><span class="smcap">Science.</span>&mdash;All general works which are not epoch-making, but
merely recapitulations of ascertained facts, should be discarded
when twenty years old. Care should be taken not
to discard any book, however old, which has not been
efficiently superseded. All ordinary text-books of every
science, save mathematics and occult science, may be discarded
when twenty years old. Nicely illustrated textbooks,
especially of zoology and botany, should be discarded
with much caution.</p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">Useful Arts.</span>&mdash;The same rule applies to this class as to Science,
save that patents, specifications, recipes, books on household
arts, and all finely illustrated books should be retained.</p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">Fine Arts.</span>&mdash;Books must be discarded very sparingly in this
section. Collections of engravings, finely illustrated books,
and collected music, not at all.</p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">Theology and Philosophy.</span>&mdash;Philosophical works, particularly
systems of philosophy, should never be discarded. Historical
and explanatory text-books may be discarded as
they become superseded by later works. Old theology,
commentaries on the Bible, sectarian literature and sermons
should be discarded very freely. Theological controversies
should never be collected by general municipal libraries
unless of local interest.</p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">Social Science.</span>&mdash;This class requires frequent revision, especially
in the sections devoted to political economy, government,
law and other topics. Books on questions of momentary
interest can be replaced by historical r&eacute;sum&eacute;s. Constantly
changing subjects like law, government and political
economy should be kept up to date as much as possible,
and the historical record kept by means of recent histories.
Questions like parliamentary reform, slavery and chartism
are illustrations of once burning topics which may just as
well be represented by a few modern histories as by actual
collections of the very voluminous literature attached to
each subject.</p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">Language and Literature.</span>&mdash;Old grammars may be discarded
without risk, and also ordinary school dictionaries. Books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
on literary history, bibliography and librarianship are tools,
and should never be discarded.</p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">Prose Fiction.</span>&mdash;Novelists mentioned in literary histories
should never be discarded. Minor novelists of all lands,
who are not mentioned in literary histories, whose works
have remained unissued for a year or two, should be promptly
discarded. So, also, should merely topical novels of no
permanent interest, which libraries are often forced to buy
under pressure. Continuous popularity is a good reason for
retaining any novel, provided it is not immoral.</p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">Poetry and Drama.</span>&mdash;Collective works should never be
discarded unless efficiently superseded. But poets and
dramatists of a day who are no longer read may be safely
discarded, but no one who is named in histories of literature.</p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">History and Geography.</span>&mdash;Historical works which are mere
r&eacute;sum&eacute;s, and not themselves original authorities, may be discarded
with comparative safety; but the matter of illustrations
again applies here with considerable force. Works
of travel of the ordinary globe-trotting description may be
discarded when ten years old, along with all kinds of guidebooks,
save those which are local. But here, again, beware
of discarding illustrated books. Pioneer works of exploration
should be retained. Old gazetteers are, as a rule, lumber,
but some of the illustrated ones, like Lewis&#8217; for Britain, may
be retained for their armorial illustrations. Histories which
are literary classics, like Hume, Robertson, Clarendon, should
be kept, even if superseded by more accurate modern works.</p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">Biography.</span>&mdash;Collected biography should never be discarded.
The biographies of nonentities in the individual biography
class may, however, be weeded pretty freely and frequently
after they are from forty to fifty years old.</p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">Miscellaneous.</span>&mdash;Discard old encyclop&aelig;dias with care; newspapers
or directories freely. Retain all local matter of this
kind however. Be extremely chary about storing inferior
magazines of the miscellany order. A long set of an old
magazine of this kind is a positive incubus, and most modern
magazines of the snippet order are not worth house-room.
Wear them out in the reading rooms by all means, but do
not preserve them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p class="hind0_2"><span class="smcap">General.</span>&mdash;All works that are defective or dirty should be discarded,
or at any rate withdrawn from general circulation.
A book defective in a plate or a section or two can sometimes
be completed by an application to the publisher for
the missing part, which is usually forthcoming at small
cost. Dirty books are the bane of municipal lending
libraries, and a ruthless policy in regard to them is a
public economy. Especially does this remark apply to
classic fiction: clean, or fresh, copies should always be available,
even if at the cost of obtaining fewer works of inferior
fiction. Many of the criticisms levelled at libraries have
been due to neglect of this matter; sometimes due, we
are sorry to say, to want of money to buy the necessary
replacements.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec201">201.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>201.</b> None of the foregoing recommendations for discarding,
except the last, applies to bibliographical rarities or curiosities; to
works of recognized literary merit which are mentioned in histories
of literature; to books which are of local interest; or to special
collections. They apply simply and solely to the rank and file
of literature, the 50 per cent. of the fruits of the press which
become stale through effluxion of time. The question of how
to dispose of discarded books can generally be decided by some
local circumstance. Discarded text-books of science are generally
of little value to anyone, and need not be preserved at all.
But faded works of travel, history and biography may find
interested readers in workhouses, hospitals and prisons. To
these, or similar institutions, the discarded books of a public
library could be transferred. It is hardly necessary to point
out that books which are not good enough or fresh enough for
a central library, are not good enough for a branch library.
Books proposed to be withdrawn permanently should be submitted
to the library committee, and lists of the discarded books
may be printed in the bulletin, if there is one, or, failing that,
in a separate form. It is useful that readers likely to be interested
should be afforded an opportunity of judging the proposals
and action of the library committee in its work of weeding out
the library. Any serious objection to a book being removed
should be considered, and nothing should be done without the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
utmost deliberation, because, as yet, we have not achieved a
public library <i>index expurgatorius</i> of books not worth preserving.
When this comes, the task will be immensely lightened. Books
which are discarded should not be permitted to leave the library
unless stamped, to indicate that they are rejected. A stamp
with a movable dating centre should be used, with the words,</p>

<p class="center blankbefore">&#8220;Public&nbsp;Library,&nbsp;Discarded,&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent blankbefore">in a circle.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec202">202. Practical Methods of Selection.</h4>

<p><b>202. Practical Methods of Selection.</b>&mdash;The number of books
which have been published to aid in book selection is somewhat
large, but few of them, save, perhaps, Sonnenschein&#8217;s publications
and Nelson&#8217;s <i>Standard Books</i>, make any attempt to indicate
the best editions of particular authors. It may be assumed
that every entry in these lists of best books represents a work
which is recommended on account of its merit, literary or otherwise.
But something more than this is required by the librarian
who is faced with the task of building up a great modern library,
and is limited in his selection to books of the most enduring
merit, and those which most completely and accurately record
the state of the science or subject to which they are devoted.
It is a very easy matter to simply order <i>books</i>, like the millionaire
who fitted up his library by the superficial yard, thereby
tempting a bookseller, entrusted with a large order for books
of a uniform size in fine bindings, to bind up some hundreds of
copies of a cheap &#8220;remainder,&#8221; in different covers, but with
varying titles, in order to provide in dummy form the necessary
mileage of books required. Public library formation can hardly
be undertaken in this happy-go-lucky manner.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec203">203.</h4>

<p><b>203.</b> The principal aids to the selection of new books are The
Library Association List of Best Books, which is an annotated,
classified and evaluated list published weekly in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>,
and <i>The A. L. A. Book-List</i>, which serves similarly for American
books, and the journals of various kinds, which review and advertise
books as published. Comparatively few of the literary
journals review books in a manner helpful to the would-be
book-buyer, because they do not describe the contents of them
so much as criticize their literary style, production, printers&#8217;
errors, etc. Generally speaking, a modern book review is what
it was in the old days of the <i>Edinburgh</i> and <i>Quarterly</i>, simply
a peg on which to hang the reviewer&#8217;s opinions on the subject<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
of the book, and on which to display his knowledge and critical
insight. Moreover, it must be remembered that publishers
advertise their wares in literary journals, and that fact may, in
some cases, not be without influence upon the views of the critics.
The subject of the book, its style of treatment, scope, and details
of its contents are left to be divined by the reader. Some of the
modern publishers&#8217; monthly catalogues are much more helpful
than any journal or review, because they add brief descriptive
notes to each entry of a new book. A plain, practical note outlining
the principal contents and intention of a book is worth
pages of critical remarks to the librarian book-buyer. The
following is a list of the journals most used by librarians in
selecting new books:</p>

<p>In addition to the very uncertain and unsatisfactory method
of thus choosing new books by their titles, because it amounts
to very little else, some arrangement is required whereby libraries
can obtain non-fictional books on view, so that they can be properly
examined before being ordered. Publishers are generally
willing to submit new publications to librarians through their
booksellers, and visits to large book stores should be made frequently.
A good plan is for a public library to maintain one or
two subscriptions with a large commercial circulating library,
through which new books may be read or examined.</p>

the largeness of the field, notes in aid of choice are badly wanted.

<h3>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="title">ACCESSION METHODS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec207">207. Donations.</h4>

<p><b>207. Donations.</b>&mdash;The first British Public Library Act did not
make any provision for funds with which to buy books: it
trusted entirely, with the innocence of extreme youth, to the
benevolence of donors. As these somewhat rare persons did not
respond in an encouraging manner, the Acts were forthwith
amended, and communities given power to purchase books from
such limited funds as were left after loans, the librarian&#8217;s salary
and the lighting bill had been settled. Although every library
benefits now and then from the generosity of donors of books and
money, donations cannot be regarded as a reliable source of
a constant and liberal supply of good and suitable books.
Indeed, it may be asserted that more printed rubbish is
bestowed annually on public libraries than anything of a useful
or valuable sort. Touting for gifts is to be avoided. It is not
only undignified, but often results in failure and a certain loss
of status to the library which employs a general begging policy.</p>

<p>State papers and public documents are carefully preserved in
many libraries in the United Kingdom. Many of the best parliamentary
papers and reports can be obtained free on application
to H.M. Stationery Office in London, but other valuable
public documents, such as some of the Record Office publications,
the Ordnance Survey, etc., must be purchased. The parliamentary
papers were not given free to public libraries till after
years of agitation dating from the time of Edwards in 1850. A
selection of these papers will be found sufficient for most libraries,
and this can be made from the lists published by H.M. Stationery
Office.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec208">208.</h4>

<p><b>208.</b> All donations, good, bad or indifferent, should be duly
recorded in a special <span class="smcapall">DONATION REGISTER</span>, and the donors should
be thanked in the usual manner, either by means of a special
circular or post-card. For the majority of donations a printed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
post-card of acknowledgment is commonly used, and specially
valuable gifts are acknowledged by special resolutions conveyed
in a handsome form. It would seem better, however, if a letter-form
of acknowledgment were generally used. Gratitude, even
for small gifts, costs little, and its expression frequently leads to
more valuable gifts. The usual wording for acknowledgments
runs thus:</p>

<p>The donation number is a progressive number which should
be given to all gifts, particularly books, because, when pencilled
on volumes which are duplicates or not stocked for any reason,
it is easy to ascertain their history by turning up the number in
the donation book. Most of the other headings explain themselves.
When books are added to the library as donations it
is well to carry into this record the accession numbers given to
them in the columns provided. In the &#8220;Remarks&#8221; column
can be entered any information as to the disposal of the gifts.
In some libraries a book is used which resembles a receipt book
in having a counterfoil and a tear-off sheet forming a thanks
circular or acknowledgment form. This style of book is less
satisfactory than the form of record given <a href="#Sec208">above</a>.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec211">211.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>211.</b> From the suggestions of the public and the committee
and his own study of reviews, catalogues, journals, etc., the
librarian prepares a list of book suggestions for the use of the
committee, or special books sub-committee, as the case may be.
This list may either be entered and kept in the suggestions book,
or written out on separate slips (5 inches &times; 3 inches), which can
be afterwards used as a catalogue for staff use. The latter plan
is preferable as being more economical and convenient, especially
when worked in conjunction with suggestion slips, of the
same size, instead of a proposition book. Some committees
require a duplicated list of the suggestions to be prepared and
circulated before they meet in order that every member may
have the opportunity of examining it beforehand. In a few
cases the librarian also (or as an alternative) obtains all the books
on approval from the bookseller, and the committee chooses from
direct examination of the books themselves. This method involves
extra labour, especially in large libraries, but is very
successful and well worth the trouble. When the list has passed
the committee, with whatever modifications they may have
imposed, the books can be ordered as described below in <a href="#Sec213">Section
213</a>. These suggestions are the main source from which the
library is built up, and ought to be prepared and examined with
great care. Arising out of this part of the subject is the question
of buying books at sales. This is often done through a bookseller
or other agent, who receives a marked copy of the catalogue,
with the prices to be offered written against each entry, and for
his services in attending and bidding 5 to 10 per cent. is generally
allowed. Of course, at any book-sale in the same town as
the library, the librarian may attend, but an experienced agent
is more likely to avoid mistakes. Unfortunately few public
libraries can afford to compete with booksellers and private collectors
in the saleroom, and practically this source of accessions
is not of much use to the majority of British public libraries.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec212">212. Subscription Books.</h4>

<p><b>212. Subscription Books.</b>&mdash;Sources of book supply in many
libraries are the works coming regularly as annuals, or from
societies to whose publications the library subscribes. Patents&#8217;
specifications, parliamentary reports and other periodical publications
also furnish a constant, if somewhat irregular, stream of
additions. There should be some simple means of checking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
these annual and irregular publications, and a series of cards,
somewhat similar to those suggested for magazines in <a href="#Sec475">Section 475</a>,
will be found very convenient. It is hardly necessary to add
that these check-cards should be examined regularly for overdues
and omissions. Societies which issue only occasional monographs
are the most difficult to trace and check. With annual
publications of a definite kind, such as <i>Whitaker&#8217;s Almanack</i>,
there is no trouble whatever.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec213">213. Ordering.</h4>

<p><b>213. Ordering.</b>&mdash;The routine of book ordering should be
reduced to the simplest possible system. There are plenty of
elaborate methods designed to find out and penalize defaulting
assistants, booksellers, etc., but they are not recommended.
The very simplest plan is to place the proposition slips, when
dealt with by the committee, in a special tray, or, better, drawer
of a card cabinet, in a compartment marked &#8220;Books passed by
committee,&#8221; and then to enter them in an ordinary order-sheet,
of which a carbon copy should be taken, or which may be copied
later. These order sheets (8 inches &times; 10 inches) may be ruled
thus:</p>

Where a duplicated (cyclostyled, mimeographed, etc.) list of
suggestions is used for the committee, a copy of this, with the
committee&#8217;s adjustments, can be used as an order list. The bookseller&#8217;s
invoice and the books are checked by the suggestion slips,
and discrepancies of price or books not supplied are revealed
immediately. The use of books for entering lists, or for other
library record purposes, is gradually giving way to the more
mobile and economical systems to be obtained by the use of
expansible files and card indexes.</p>

guides to indicate the contents of each compartment (<a href="#Fig61">Fig. 61</a>).</p>

<p>This plan of keeping check of books on order, at every stage,
will be found much simpler, and more accurate and convenient

The absurd and most inconvenient practice of publishing novels,
reference books, and indeed any kind of work, with uncut leaves,
is one which causes more waste of time and irritation than almost
anything else in connexion with books. A publisher may be
justified in sending out special books in limited editions with
uncut edges and leaves unopened, but every other kind of book
should have its edges neatly and smoothly trimmed and its leaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
cut in readiness for the reader. It is cleaner and more convenient,
because nothing holds dust like the rough top and fore-edges of
books cut with a paper-knife, and for this reason alone it should
be made a penal offence to issue books with unopened leaves.</p>

<span class="smcapall">CUTTING</span> of the leaves of new books
is the next step in the preparation of books for public use, and
as regards the latter it is necessary to insist that the leaves should
be cut close into the backs of the books, and not left uncut to
within half or quarter an inch of the back, so that an ugly
tear is made whenever the book is fully opened. A half-cut book
is an abomination not to be endured.</p>

<p>Various kinds of stamps are used, ink, embossing and perforating.
The ink ones, usually applied with rubber dies, are
not altogether satisfactory when used with ordinary aniline endorsing
inks, as they can be erased. Printers&#8217; ink is more satisfactory,
but it takes some time to dry, and requires metal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
stamps to make it work easily. The ink used by the Post Office
when applied with a metal stamp has been found effective. But
for their expense embossing stamps are most satisfactory, and
of the various kinds of these the perforating stamp formed like
a pair of nippers is the easiest to apply. Whatever kind of
stamp is used, it should be made in a circular shape, as in whatever
position it is applied it never appears to be upside down or
uneven, as other shapes too frequently do.</p>

<p>Every library should select certain fixed pages on which the
stamps are to be placed, and every title-page, first and last pages
of text, and all plates should be stamped. As a rule too much
time is wasted in stamping library books, and it will be found
quite enough to stamp the places indicated, and use a blind
embossing stamp for the boards.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">This will cause occasional irregularities in the progression of
numbers of the &#8220;Accession Number&#8221; column, but it is of much
greater importance not to allow extensive blanks to occur in this
series of numbers, as it will play havoc with the charging system
later on. This method of re-entering cannot be done with stock
books having the accession numbers ready printed, and librarians
who use this form must make up their minds to run a very
irregular series of numbers.</p>

<p>The whole process can be simplified by the use of a loose-leaf
accession book, such as the &#8220;Kalamazoo&#8221; ledgers. As entries
become congested by the substitution of other books for those
originally stocked, the congested pages can be re-written as a
whole. A register of discarded books or withdrawals can be kept<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
in a separate book&mdash;the superseded loose leaves can be filed for
the purpose&mdash;if it is thought desirable to retain a record of books
which have been and are no longer in the library; but experience
has not shown such a record to have any precise or practical value.</p>

<p>As in many other branches of library work, the tendency in
accession work is to elaborate every process instead of simplifying
it. The simplest form of stock book is that in which a
specially ruled counterfoil is attached to the order forms and
which only provides columns for accession and class numbers,
author, title and number of volumes, publisher and price. After
all a stock book need only be a kind of record of origin, and not
necessarily an epitome, of the catalogue and classification. What
a stock book is wanted for is to answer the questions: When did
a given book come; where did it come from; what did it cost;
how many books does the library possess; what are they about?
There are so many records which give other particulars, that it
seems a great waste of time to repeat a large number of the particulars
given in some stock books.</p>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>228.</b> Opinion is divided upon the point, but usually in the
enumeration of the stock of a library no distinction is made
between a book and a pamphlet; every number represents a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
complete item, and the number of pages or subject-matter does
not enter into the question; and for accession purposes a
pamphlet is a book or work, whether it extends to a hundred
pages or consists of but four. The Library Association, however,
recommends that in presenting public statistics of stocks, as
in annual reports, there should be differentiation, and gives the
following definitions<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Volumes</i> mean books as they stand on the shelves. <i>Pieces</i>
mean separate works or parts (each usually having a separate
title-page to itself, as with pamphlets, parts of periodicals, and
the like); <i>Papers</i> mean lesser items, usually with less than five
pages, as broadsides, cards, flysheets and prints; <i>Items</i> mean
volumes, pieces, papers, lantern-slides, and generally all material
constituting the library stock, and issued to readers; <i>Works</i>
mean whole literary productions, whether in several volumes or
only one piece. Thus&mdash;ten pamphlets bound together, with
five broadsides at end, are one volume, ten works or pieces,
fifteen items. A dictionary in twenty volumes would count as
twenty volumes, pieces, and items, but one work, and in a sense
one book. Having regard to these definitions, care should be
taken in recording the number of volumes in a library, to reckon
ten pamphlets or parts as the equivalent of a single volume.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus, if these definitions are used, it becomes necessary to
indicate in the stock book the nature of the work; and to
differentiate, one or two symbols, such as p.=pamphlet, and
pr.=paper, may be used; but if &#8220;p.&#8221; is written in the &#8220;No.
of vols.&#8221; column to distinguish a pamphlet, that will meet all
usual statistical purposes.</p>

<h2>DIVISION VII<br />
CLASSIFICATION AND SHELF ARRANGEMENT</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XV<br />
<span class="title">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec230">230.</h4>

<p><b>230.</b> There is no more important factor in the success or failure
of a library than the classification of the books and other material
which form its stock. Some of its uses are obvious to all readers;
it brings the material on any subject together on the shelves and
in the catalogues, and thus enables both librarian and reader to
find books readily. It has perhaps more important uses, because
it enables the librarian, and, in open access libraries, the public,
to see the strength and weakness of the collection in various
subjects; it, therefore, is the only safe and certain means by
which a collection may be built up systematically, and may be
increased. Moreover, it reveals the obsolete books merely by
bringing them into juxtaposition with books which have superseded
them. An imperfectly classified, or unclassified, library
resembles chaos as nearly as anything can do, and want of
classification renders the finest collection of books useless except
to those who already know all there is to be known of any subject
in which they may be interested, and who can therefore find the
books by other means. In short, classification is the primary
key to the assembling, finding, selecting and rejecting of
books.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec231">231.</h4>

<p><b>231.</b> It does even more than this. A perfectly or logically
constructed classification shows not only all the books on a
specific subject; it also shows the books which are collateral,
or which lead up to and away from the books on the specific
subject. It will readily be seen, therefore, that the art of classification
is one that must be understood thoroughly by the successful
librarian. Several text-books have been written on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
subject, and many articles have appeared advocating and criticizing
various systems. We can give here only a few leading
principles, and afterwards discuss the four or five schemes which
have received most general recognition from librarians.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec232">232.</h4>

<p><b>232.</b> A classification system is a schedule or chart of knowledge
arranged in some logical order according to a definite and
invariable principle. It may arrange knowledge by the historical,
evolutionary or some other and arbitrary principle, the choice of
which is governed by the rule that the order must be that which
is likely to be most serviceable to the users of the system. Special
classifications, such as would be necessary for arranging a collection
devoted to anthropology, or botany, or arch&aelig;ology, naturally
arrange books by the principle that will most clearly reveal their
place in the progress of the subject required; and such classifications
are merely mentioned in passing. General classifications,
which are the business of the average librarian, usually
proceed in the historical or evolutionary order we have mentioned.
Their schedules consist of a number of general headings,
called main classes, which are divided by gradual steps in accordance
with the principle employed until specific headings are
reached. Each of the headings must be exclusive of subjects
not falling into it. In order to make this schedule of subjects
practicable as a method of book arrangement, it must be equipped
with special &#8220;form&#8221; classes which accommodate general works,
or works of so composite a character that they do not fall into
any of the subject-classes; and which also accommodate such
aggregates of literature as poetry, drama, essays, fiction, etc.,
which are arranged by the form in which the matter in them is
presented, and not by the matter itself. Further, it must be
equipped with a notation, or a shorthand sign for each of the
subjects in the schedule, which may be written on the backs of
books and in catalogues instead of the names of the subjects.
And, finally, it must have an index which forms a ready key to
the tables of the schedule, and is a convenient means of checking
the placings of books.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec233">233.</h4>

<p><b>233.</b> The theory of classification is a subject for special study,
and there are rules of order, division, nomenclature, notation
and indexing which it is useful for a library student to master.
As the ground has been covered adequately by the text-books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
which are listed at the end of this, we shall do better to refer the
reader to these rather than to enlarge this manual by attempting
to traverse it.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="title">SYSTEMATIC CLASSIFICATION SCHEMES</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec235">235. General.</h4>

<p><b>235. General.</b>&mdash;Quite a large number of classification schemes
have been devised by Continental, American and British
librarians, in which books are systematically arranged according
to related topics, and marked with a notation which enables any
book or subject to be distinguished by its number, for purposes
of shelving, charging and cataloguing. All the best known of
such schemes are described in Brown&#8217;s <i>Library Classification
and Cataloguing</i>, London, 1912, and Richardson&#8217;s <i>Classification</i>,
1912. It will be sufficient to name the methods of Harris, Perkins
and Smith, of America; Edwards and Sonnenschein, of England;
Bonazzi, of Italy; and Hartwig, of Germany, which, with the
well-known French scheme of Brunet, make up a very interesting
collection of international contributions to the classification of
books. None of these schemes has been adopted in more than
one or two libraries, so that their influence is not sufficiently
widespread to make any further description of their details necessary.
It will be much more helpful to librarians if the chief
systems of classification are mentioned which fulfil every requirement
as regards notation and general adaptability to library
work, and have been put to the practical test of application in a
number of libraries. The systems in question are the Decimal,
Expansive, Library of Congress, and Subject, the last being
English and the three others American. They have all been
extensively adopted, and each exists as a separate printed work,
with an index; a vital part of any method of classification.
Unprinted schemes, or those of merely theoretical interest, have
little practical value, and though every librarian has his own ideas
of classification, and generally manages to graft them on to the
scheme of some other person, and even to nibble away at his original,
it is the best and wisest course to adopt a complete, printed
and accessible scheme with as little modification as possible.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec236">236. Decimal Classification.</h4>

<p><b>236. Decimal Classification.</b>&mdash;This, the most popular and
widely applied of all library schemes, was invented by Melvil
Dewey in 1873-76, and has been under revision constantly since,
and is to-day in general a very extensive and detailed scheme.
As indicated by its name, the system is divided into groups of
ten, and from this results an admirable notation of unlimited
expansibility.</p>

<p>Its chief divisions are as follows:</p>

<p>This scheme is published separately as <i>Tables and Index of
the Decimal Classification and relative Index for arranging and
cataloguing Libraries, Clippings, Notes, etc.</i>, by Melvil Dewey,
Boston, and has been largely expanded, with an elaborate
additional apparatus of form and relation marks, by the
Institut International de Bibliographie, Brussels.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec237">237. Expansive Classification.</h4>

<p><b>237. Expansive Classification.</b>&mdash;This system was devised by
Charles Amni Cutter, a well-known American librarian, and
author of the code of <i>Rules for a Dictionary Catalogue</i>, which has
been a text-book for many years. The Expansive Classification
has not been adopted to any extent in Britain, but is printed in
a series of seven classifications of progressive fullness, and completely
indexed, and so becomes one of the methods to be studied.</p>

<p>This scheme is published separately as <i>Expansive Classification:
the first six Expansions</i>, by C. A. Cutter, Boston, 1891,
etc., and a seventh expansion of the work is being issued under
the supervision of W. P. Cutter, nephew of the author, but no
parts have been published for several years.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec238">238. Library of Congress.</h4>

<p><b>238. Library of Congress.</b>&mdash;This is the elaborate and detailed
scheme applied to the great Library of Congress, and is the work
of its classification department. Its outline (1909) is based
upon that of the Expansive scheme of Cutter which is shown
<a href="#Sec237">above</a>, but is varied to meet what are thought to be the special
needs of the American national library. Each of the classes has
been published separately in convenient form with an index.</p>

<p>The main classes and divisions of the Library of Congress
Classification are as follows:</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec239">239. Subject Classification.</h4>

<p><b>239. Subject Classification.</b>&mdash;This, the most recent British
scheme, is the work of the author of this manual, James Duff
Brown; is a complete, homogeneous, detailed and well-indexed
scheme, and is selected for notice as being generally applicable
to British libraries of all kinds, although it is not likely to oust
the Decimal scheme from its priority of place. It is based on
the principle of placing all topics in a logical sequence; of keeping
applications of theory as close as possible to the foundation
theory; and of providing one place only for each important
topic. The complications and intersections of human knowledge
prevent anything more than an approximation to this
ideal, but it has been found in actual practice to be a classification
scheme which works easily and harmoniously.</p>

<p>The following extracts from its valuable introduction will
give the best view of the principles on which the system is based:</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">The Order of the Main Classes.</span>&mdash;The reasons which
determined the adoption of a certain sequence of classes in this
system may be briefly set forth here, instead of any argument
or attempt to justify the order. The battle which has raged,
and is still raging, among scientists, as to the best and most
desirable order in which to arrange the great branches of human
knowledge in order to produce a &#8216;hierarchy,&#8217; must deter a non-scientific
classifier from arguing on such a complicated and
difficult topic. It will, therefore, suffice if I briefly describe
the main classes in their order and give reasons why they were
assigned to the places they occupy.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">A Generalia.</span>&mdash;The divisions of this main class comprise
most of the rules, methods and factors which are of general
application, and which qualify or pervade every branch of
science, industry or human study. They are universal and
pervasive, and cannot be logically assigned to any other single
main class as peculiar or germane to it.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">B, C, D Physical Sciences.</span>&mdash;Matter, force, motion and
their applications are assumed to precede life and mind, and for
that reason the material side of science, with its applications,
has been selected as a foundation main class on which to construct
the system.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">E, F Biological Science.</span>&mdash;Life and its forms, arising out
of matter, occupy the second place among the main classes, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
here are put general biological theories and facts, followed by
plant and animal life, each in an ascending order from low to
high forms of organization.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">G, H Ethnological and Medical Science.</span>&mdash;Human life,
its varieties, physical history, disorders and recreations, follows
naturally as a higher development of plant and animal life, and
completes the biological chain.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">I Economic Biology and Domestic Arts.</span>&mdash;The applications
of plant and animal life to human needs, placed midway
between the physical and mental attributes of man as indicating
the primitive exercise of mind, and to assemble in one sequence
the chief biological subjects. As a matter of practical convenience,
rather than logical necessity, it was thought better to keep
composite subjects like Agriculture, Clothing, Foods, etc.&mdash;involving
questions of origin, use and manufacture&mdash;all in one
place, close to the main classes from which they are derived,
rather than to distribute them more closely at Botany or Zoology.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">J, K Philosophy and Religion.</span>&mdash;Mental attributes, order
and beliefs of human life, following naturally from its physical
basis, and primitive manifestation in the instinct of procuring
food and clothing.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">L Social and Political Science.</span>&mdash;Social order and laws
of human life. Placed here because, although society or family
and other tribal organizations may have preceded religion, mind
as embodied in philosophy must have preceded both.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">M Language and Literature.</span>&mdash;Communication and recording
in human life. The spoken, written and printed word,
which grew as a necessity out of the primitive operations of mind.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">N Literary Forms.</span>&mdash;The products of communication and
recording in human life in their more imaginative forms; placed
here on the ground that fable probably preceded more formal
history.</p>

<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">O-X History, Geography, Biography.</span>&mdash;The actions,
records and descriptions of human life and its dwelling-place.
Arranged in this order and at this place because of their intimate
connexion. Geography, although logically related to Physiography
and Biography to Ethnology, are, nevertheless, as a
matter of practical utility, and because of the literature actually
existing, more naturally grouped here than separated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;The order of the classes may, therefore, be briefly described
as expressing:</p>

<ul class="nostyle">

<li>1. Matter.</li>
<li>2. Life.</li>
<li>3. Mind.</li>
<li>4. Record.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></li>

</ul>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_8" id="Footnote_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a>
From <i>Subject Classification</i>, by James Duff Brown, 1906, pp. 11-13; second
edition, 1914.</p></div>

<p>The only serious objection which has been urged against this
scheme is the inclusion of Education, Logic, Mathematics, and
the Graphic and Plastic Arts in Generalia. This course is,
however, fully justified by the somewhat amusing circumstance,
that the critics are unable to agree among themselves as to the
exact logical place of any of the series. While one insists that
Logic should be placed in Philosophy, he is bound to admit
that it ought not to be separated from Mathematics, while on
the other hand he cannot allow arithmetic, book-keeping and
geometry to invade the sacred temple of the philosophers.
Education is even a greater stumbling-block. It is variously
assigned to Psychology, Sociology, Philology and Ethnology
by different critics, and Fine Arts is equally perplexing. In
actual practice in a library, there is really no inconvenience
felt in connexion with the distribution of any of these classes,
and as they do not originate naturally from any of the other
main divisions, but qualify and pervade the whole of them like
an encyclop&aelig;dia, or other general work, it will be found best
to retain them where they are. The other important features
of this system are described below.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Categorical Tables</span> form an important feature, whereby
a separate series of forms, phases and other qualifying factors
are provided, which can be applied to every subject, and so
relieve the main tables from congestion. They are applicable
to the very largest libraries, and give ample means of subdividing
any topic, however large it may be. They can also
be used with other systems of classification, as they are independent
of the main tables and form a series of parallel
numbers by which the classification numbers can be themselves
classified. For example, a library may have 1000 books on a
subject like Architecture in general, to all of which the simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
number B300 would be applied. By adding the qualifying
numbers from the Categorical Tables, which appear after a
point, and are invariably the same when applied to any subject,
the following sub-classification would result, which has the
effect of assembling all related forms of books together:</p>

<table class="fsize80" summary="categorial table">

</table>

<p class="noindent">and so on.</p>

<p>If, in addition to those general works, the library possessed
several hundreds of books on Building Construction, B305,
these would be subdivided in exactly the same manner, as would
also any subdivision of the same topic, such as Foundations,
Walls, Roofs, etc.:</p>

<table class="fsize80" summary="categorial table">

<tr>
<td class="left padr1">B305&middot;1</td>
<td class="center padl1 padr1">Building</td>
<td class="center padl1 padr1">Construction,</td>
<td class="left">Bibliography</td>

<tr>
<td class="left padr1">B329&middot;1</td>
<td colspan="3" class="left">Roofs, Bibliography</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p class="noindent">These categorical tables are therefore of universal application,
and as they contain nearly one thousand qualifying forms,
phases, etc., it will be seen that their use will greatly simplify
the practical work of classification.</p>

<p>As will be seen by the above examples, the symbols of the
Notation are perfectly simple combinations of letters and
numbers. By treating the numbers decimally, it is possible
to intercalate as many new ones as desired between any of
the existing numbers, thus providing an infinity of places.</p>

<p>The Index is very extensive in the number of subject-words
it contains, and comprises practically every topic likely to be
encountered in ordinary practice. The Classification Tables
themselves provide places somewhere for every remote subject,
and the Introduction describes how such out-of-the-way matters
are to be treated.</p>

<p>It is impossible to set forth all the features of this system of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
classification&mdash;its elaborate series of <i>biographical numbers</i> for
arranging Fiction, Poetry and other alphabetical classes; its
new system of short <i>date-marks</i>; its rules for the <i>arrangement
of special subjects</i>, authors, etc.; and its notes on the simplification
of the whole subject of book classification. Reference can
only be made to the Summary Table of Main Classes for an idea
of the size and style of the book.</p>

<p><b>240. Adjustable Classification.</b>&mdash;The Subject Classification is
the second scheme invented by Brown which has achieved
success. The earlier scheme was the <i>Adjustable Classification
for Libraries, with Index</i>, London, 1898, and is interesting as
the forerunner of the much larger subject scheme. Only the
main classes are given here:</p>

<span class="title">PRACTICAL APPLICATION</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec241">241. Numbers.</h4>

<p><b>241. Numbers.</b>&mdash;The class letters and numbers of all books
should be written in the inside, preferably on the back or front
of the title-page, and should also be carried on to the labels, book-cards
and all other records. On the outside the class letters
and numbers may be lettered in gilt or written on a suitable tag,
which must be firmly pasted on the back. The usual position
for the tag is at about 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches from the foot of the back, as
this gives regular and uniform marking, which looks neat. Some
librarians prefer a place at the top of the back, as the arranging
number thus becomes more prominent, and the tag at the foot
is more subject to handling. The <a href="#Fig73">diagram</a> shows the two
methods.</p>

a series of elaborate auxiliary marks to distinguish book from
book in the same subdivision. Thus, in the Decimal scheme,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
621&middot;18 is the number for books on boilers. If there are six books
on this topic, some distinction must be used in charging to
enable the librarian to know which book has been issued. Mr
Cutter has devised a table for this purpose, which is known as
the &#8220;Cutter Author Marks,&#8221; by which surnames are arranged
according to their initials and qualified by a number thus:</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 74.</span>&mdash;Colour Marking of Books.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">These marks are simple round spots of coloured enamel
painted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
on the backs of books, and they effectually prevent shelf being
mixed with shelf and tier with tier. There are eight shelves in
a tier, and eight distinctive colours are used, so that no colour
is repeated in the same tier, and they are varied in every succeeding
tier, so that adjoining shelves will not correspond in the
colour of their marking. As a further precaution, the class
marks are placed at different heights on the backs of the books
in each tier, so that, even if a red-marked book from Tier 1 were
placed among the red-marked books on Tier 3, there would still
be a distinction. Of course the same level is maintained for
each tier, by means of gauges, and the progression of colours
is observed. When a book moves forward to another shelf, the
mark is painted over with the new colour, and when the book
is moved to another tier, the mark is carefully scraped out and
altered to suit the new location. As movement is not extensive
in ordinary libraries, this alteration is only an occasional duty.
The class numbers maintain the topic order on the shelves, and
so the most common method of open access shelf marking is
complete. It has been argued that the class letters and numbers
are all-sufficient to maintain order in a library which allows
readers to go to the shelves, but on this point experience varies.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
At any rate, there is no harm in taking simple precautions of
this kind, which certainly possess the great advantage that if a
book is misplaced it can be noticed instantly and rectified. Uniform
form marks require closer scrutiny, the use of colours demands
but a casual glance. In closely classified libraries where there
is no public access to the shelves, simple class numbers ought
to be sufficient for staff purposes. The only additional point is
that, perhaps, the accession numbers should also figure on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
backs of the books, especially if an indicator is used for charging
in the lending department.</p>

<p><b>244.</b> It is desirable that the arrangement of the shelves should
be made as clear as possible to the staff and to readers by means
of various guides, and these are particularly necessary in open
access libraries. The best general guide is a plan of the department
showing the disposition of the books in the cases, and
indicating the sequence of the classification by means of arrows.
The plan of the Croydon Central Lending Library may serve
as an example. If the classes are indicated chromatically:
for example, 000 red, 100 blue, 200 yellow, 300 green, etc.,
the plan will be more easily followed. Such a plan, drawn to a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
large scale, framed, and hung in a conspicuous position, will give
readers a valuable conspectus of the department.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">In addition, a series of bold class labels at the top of each
class, and plenty of topic labels on the shelves, together with the
progressive class numbers boldly printed, and fixed to the end
of each shelf, will be found a great help to understanding the
classification and finding the books. Shelf topic and number
labels can be printed by the staff with an ordinary rubber-printing
or sign-writing apparatus, and they can be fixed to the
shelves by means of the label-holders mentioned in <a href="#Sec249">Section 249</a>.
For class numbers on the shelf-ends xylonite label-holders will
be found economical and convenient, as they can be cut into
inch widths. The above figure (<a href="#Fig76">Fig. 76</a>) of a shelf-front
with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
labels will give some idea of the application of these marks.
The class number of the first or last topic only need be given.
A method of guiding by tiers instead of by shelves is described
in <i>The Library World</i> (Nov. 1904) and is one of many experiments
which have been made with shelf guiding. The illustrations
(<a href="#Fig77">Figs. 77</a>, <a href="#Fig78">78</a>) will show much better than words the appearance
and possibilities of this system. Another form is illustrated
below (<a href="#Fig79">Fig. 79</a>) and shows a class label for indicating the chief
contents of a main class. The illustration of an open access
lending library given opposite (<a href="#Fig80">Fig. 80</a>) shows the system of
press guides used at the North Islington Library, which in
practice has been found very effective.</p>

ruling, with the class letter and number, and the books in the
section are entered in author-alphabetical order to begin with,
afterwards just as books are added (<a href="#Fig81">Fig. 81</a>). The narrow
columns are reserved for checking the shelves. The date of
check is written at the top, and the presence of the book indicated
by a tick. In some open access libraries stock is taken of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
the shelves twice a year by means of these sheets. Missing
books are not ticked, but noted in order that further search may
be made in the charging system and other records. When they
turn up they are ticked off. The sheets are collated periodically,
and any books which continue to be unaccounted for are noted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
and entered in a special book ruled to show author and title,
date missing, and having a column for the record of any subsequent

of recovery.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec246">246. Dummies and Overflow Stock.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>246. Dummies and Overflow Stock.</b>&mdash;Sometimes the library becomes
congested at certain places owing to limited space and
rapid growth, and if discarding is not resorted to some of the
less popular, or old, books must be removed to a supplementary
store. There is scarcely a library which does not possess a second
classification stored apart, where such crowded-out books are
kept. On the shelf-register these books can either be indicated
by some such means as a red-ink cross, or they can be removed
from the original and entered on supplementary sheets.
Dummies, such as those described in <a href="#Sec247">Section 247</a>, can also be
used to show books located elsewhere, especially in open access
libraries, or lists can be mounted on cards and kept beside each
tier. The question of surplus stock is one which ought to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
dealt with on the broad lines of the discarding policy discussed
in <a href="#Sec199">Section 199</a>, but, of course, an actual division of stock caused
by overcrowding must be treated as recommended above.</p>

<p>Large and odd-sized books should be shelved in special presses,
and their place in the classification can be indicated by means of
dummies, as described <a href="#Sec247">below</a>.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec247">247. Shelf Accessories.</h4>

<p><b>247. Shelf Accessories.</b>&mdash;For the purpose of maintaining
order on the shelves and marking particular divisions or classes,
various devices have from time to time been introduced.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dummies</span> are used to indicate the temporary absence of books,
or to show that particular works, because of their large size, are
located on some other shelf. The simplest form of shelf dummy
for classification purposes is a block of wood about 7 inches &times;
5 inches &times; <sup>5</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inch, painted white, or covered with white paper
on the edge, and lettered with the title of the book which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
represents. The title may be written on each of the seven-inch
faces, in case the block gets reversed, and should also bear a
plain direction to the location of the book it represents (<a href="#Fig82">Fig. 82</a>).
[A similar dummy, bearing the classification number and the
name of the division, serves as a good guide to the classification.
The block is inserted at the beginning of each new classification
sequence; and both in this case, as in that of the dummy that
represents books, the dummy is too unlike a book to be taken
for anything other than a guide.]</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec248">248.</h4>

<p><b>248.</b> For books temporarily withdrawn a piece of millboard
covered white on one side may be used in the form shown below
(<a href="#Fig83">Fig. 83</a>). This should have the author, number and title of the
missing book written on the white side. One board of this sort
can be used over and over again for different books, by simply
adding the new title and obliterating the old one. This board
can also be used instead of the block above illustrated (<a href="#Fig82">Fig. 82</a>)
if space is a matter of moment.</p>

<p>The object of the tail in this form of board is to prevent the
board from disappearing behind or getting lost among the other
books. When placed between two books, with the projection
overhanging the front of the shelf, it will always stick out so
as to be seen readily, while it cannot very readily be pushed
deep into the shelf because of the projection.</p>

other labels in place upon the fore-edges of shelves, close to the
books which they indicate, are made in various forms. An old
form was made out of tin or thin japanned iron, with a pair of
flanges on the upper and lower edges to take a card-label. This
was screwed or tacked on to the edge of the shelf and shifted
when necessary. Another form of this holder is made precisely
the same as regards the turned-over flanges to form grooves,
but without the screw-holes, and has in addition a long projection
to slide under the books on the shelf so as to keep in place.
This can be moved easily, but it is very apt to be pulled out
when books are removed. A simple, effective shelf label-holder
is made from strips of transparent xylonite bent in a rectangular
form, and pinned or screwed to the under-side of the shelf as
illustrated (<a href="#Fig84">Fig. 84</a>). This can be made to fit into shelves with
either square or rounded edges, and keeps the labels clean, as it
covers them over. The advantage of this form of label-holder
is that it can be cut with a pair of scissors or a knife to any
size<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>

<p><b>250.</b> <span class="smcap">Book-Rests and Shelf Guides.</span>&mdash;Practically every
librarian born before 1880 has invented a book-rest at some
period of his career, and there is consequently the less need for
describing more than one or two typical devices. The best-known
form is the ordinary rectangular metal rest, which is
made in several styles in japanned iron. <a href="#Fig85">Fig. 85</a> is the commonest
form, though it is objectionable, because books are apt to
be impaled upon the sharp edge and damaged, and occasionally
the rest itself is lost. A better, though slightly more expensive,
form is <a href="#Fig86">Fig. 86</a>. By reason of the flanged side there is no danger
of books being damaged, and this side can also be used as a
classification guide if wanted to indicate where one class begins
and another ends. A variation of the dummy mentioned in
<a href="#Sec247">Section 247</a> (<a href="#Fig82">Fig. 82</a>) is a plain wooden block mounted on metal
angle pieces which can be made to act as a useful label-holder in
classified libraries. The illustration (<a href="#Fig87">Fig. 87</a>) will show the
form of this device.</p>

<p>Another form of book-rest or support is sufficiently described
by the illustration (<a href="#Fig88">Fig. 88</a>).</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec251">251. Book-Stands and Carriers.</h4>

<p><b>251. Book-Stands and Carriers.</b>&mdash;For desk and table use there
are two very convenient and adjustable book-stands, which
will be found useful in public as well as private libraries. One
is the American stand with adjustable wire compartments,
which is useful for keeping books handy for desk use or for
sorting out cards, etc.</p>

<p><b>252.</b> The other is the English adjustable book-stand which
is largely used for displaying and carrying about a few books
for committee or consultation purposes. As a table book-holder,
this is probably the best and strongest form ever invented. As
shown in the illustration (<a href="#Fig89">Fig. 89</a>), the uprights slide and firmly
grip a large or small number of books, according to the
capacity of the holder. This contrivance has been adapted as
a library book-carrier, by having strong hooks attached, which
fit into staples affixed to the fronts or ends of bookcases. They
are very useful for classifying and arranging books awaiting
replacement or shelving.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>There are other forms of book-holders and carriers with fixed
upright ends, but they are not so satisfactory as the adjustable
forms described.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec253">253.</h4>

<p><b>253.</b> In large libraries a book-truck will be found a useful
appliance for moving quantities of books about, either for purposes
of service or location or cataloguing. The design in <a href="#Fig90">Fig. 90</a>

<h2>DIVISION VIII<br />
CATALOGUING, FILING, INDEXING</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="title">CATALOGUING METHOD</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec256">256. General.</h4>

<p><b>256. General.</b>&mdash;Of the interior administrative work of the
municipal, or even more of the university or institutional library,
that which occupies most time and thought is cataloguing. A
catalogue is properly defined as an explanatory, logically-arranged
inventory and key to the books and their contents,
and differs from a bibliography in being confined to the books
in a given library. For its production wide knowledge both of
cataloguing rules and of general subjects is required, and experience
in ordinary reference work is essential. The staff, therefore,
to whom the cataloguing is entrusted should be highly
trained and well educated; that is to say, that part of the staff
which deals with the final processes in cataloguing&mdash;the choice
of headings, treatment of titles, annotation, selection of added
entries, and the filing of the finished material. In large libraries
cataloguing staffs are chosen with care, and cataloguing rooms
are arranged for the work with a careful regard to the value of
natural lighting, of furniture so arranged that the cataloguer
has not to rise from his desk every time he wishes to make a
reference, and, indeed, with the object of producing the best
results at a minimum expenditure of energy. Even in the
smallest library, where the librarian does the cataloguing, a
preliminary attention to such matters as the construction of the
cataloguing table and its accessibility to the inevitable cataloguer&#8217;s
reference books, will save much labour hereafter. It may
not be superfluous to add that as cataloguing is exacting work,
it is fatiguing work, and no assistant should be kept at it without
variation for a longer time than he can remain mentally alert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
and fresh. Eye-strain and fatigue mean inaccuracy, and at the
best inefficient work, and seven hours is a maximum that should
not be exceeded.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec257">257. Kinds of Catalogue.</h4>

<p><b>257. Kinds of Catalogue.</b>&mdash;There is no more important decision
that a librarian has to make than that of the form which
the catalogue is to take. A wrong choice here will produce
months of labour to make good the error. The choice will no
doubt be influenced by the kind of public for which the catalogue
is required. The public may be general in character, and within
that somewhat vague definition may be artisan, or commercial,
or what not; or it may be special&mdash;with a large number of
students. The public a municipal library has to serve usually
combines all these elements; and in choosing the form of catalogue,
a librarian may be guided by the desire to serve them all,
but to emphasize the educational side of his work. The questions
which a catalogue or catalogues may be expected to answer
are: what books has the library (<i>a</i>) by a given author, (<i>b</i>) on a
given subject, (<i>c</i>) having a given title. Most catalogues may,
by the addition of indexes, be made to yield this information
with varying degrees of efficiency. The various forms, and
examples of them, should be considered carefully before the
choice is made. Those most recognized are the <i>Author</i> catalogue,
the <i>Dictionary</i> catalogue, the <i>Classified</i> catalogue, and
the <i>Alphabetical-Classed</i> catalogue.</p>

<p>The <i>author</i> catalogue is most valuable in the hands of literary
men and of experts, but is of very limited use to the reader
whose knowledge of authors is small. It is simply an alphabetical
arrangement of author entries of books, without any
reference in that arrangement to their subjects. The best
examples of this form of cataloguing are the British Museum
<i>Catalogue of the Printed Books</i> and the <i>Author Catalogue</i> of the
London Library.</p>

<p>The <i>dictionary</i> catalogue is the form most popular here and in
America, and, unfortunately, is usually the most defective.
As its name implies, it resembles the ordinary alphabetical
arrangement of the dictionary, and embraces in one alphabet
entries of authors, subjects, titles, and series. The principle of
subject entry is that books are entered under the specific subject,
and not usually under broad headings; thus books on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
Trees are entered under that word, and not, as in a classified
catalogue, under their historical, or logical, place in Botany.
The dictionary form is that most attractive to the general reader,
and in its ideal form is a remarkably effective instrument; that
is to say, when it analyses the subjects in books, and links all
specific and general headings by cross-references. The best
examples are the Brooklyn <i>Library Catalogue</i> and the <i>Index
Catalogue</i> of the U.S. Surgeon-General&#8217;s Library; and good
English examples, which will repay study, are the catalogues
of Bishopsgate Institute, London, and of Hampstead Public
Libraries which seems to be modelled on the Bishopsgate
catalogue. Objections to the dictionary catalogue are that it
gives no connected view of any subject and of its collateral subjects,
that it is rarely cross-referenced adequately, that headings
are chosen haphazard, and, what is its chief objection, if it is
printed it is out-of-date the day after publication&mdash;an objection
which does not apply so much to the printed classified catalogue,
as that lends itself to publication, and to revision, a class at a
time. Librarians using this form should base their subject
entries upon the <i>A. L. A. List of Subject Headings</i> (second edition,
1912) or the <i>Library of Congress List</i> (in progress, issued in
parts by the Library), as these will secure a choice of recognized
headings and save much labour in deciding between alternative
headings. The application of the Library of Congress list may
be studied in The Library Association <i>Index to Periodicals</i>
(1915-16), which is, in the main, arranged upon it.</p>

<p>The <i>classified</i> catalogue&mdash;the best accessible example of which
is the catalogue of the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh (1895-1902,
supplements, 1902-06 and 1907-11), while good English examples
are issued by The Patent Office, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Islington
(selected catalogue), Bolton and Walthamstow&mdash;is gradually
ousting the dictionary catalogue from the favour of librarians.
In this form books are arranged in the order of the classification,
in the perfect form in the strict order of it, and under each
specific heading the books can be arranged alphabetically or
(preferably) in chronological or inverse-chronological order, or
in the order which places the best book first. Such a catalogue
shows the whole &#8220;family&#8221; literature of every subject in a
logical progression, and is therefore much more valuable to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
student than other forms. It must, however, be equipped with
author and subject indexes to make it usable by ordinary readers
who have not grasped the scheme of classification; such indexes
are usually placed at the end of the catalogue, or class if the
catalogue is issued in class lists, and the catalogue is prefaced
with an outline of the scheme.</p>

<p>The <i>alphabetical-classed</i> catalogue is one in which the books
are arranged under specific subjects and the subject headings
are arranged in alphabetical order. Excellent examples of the
method are the Library Association <i>Index to Periodicals</i> and
(with briefer entries) the London Library <i>Subject Index</i>, and the
British Museum <i>Subject Index</i>. As the last two examples show,
this form is usually provided as an index to be used in conjunction
with a separate author catalogue, but complete, individual
catalogues have been produced in this form. Its advantages
are those accruing to the alphabet, rapid reference and easy
recognition; its disadvantages are the inevitable separations of
allied topics.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec258">258. Annotation, etc.</h4>

<p><b>258. Annotation, etc.</b>&mdash;In all forms of catalogue the difficulties
which have to be obviated are the lack of clearness of
meaning in titles and of information as to the qualifications of
authors, the scope, size, <i>format</i>, date and other features of books.
These particulars can, and should, be given as a rule under the
principal entry of each book as part of the main entry; but
to amplify such information, notes&mdash;technically called annotations&mdash;are
now frequently provided. An admirable conspectus
of the art of annotation is available in E. A. Savage&#8217;s <i>Manual of
Annotation in Library Catalogues</i>, and the student is referred to
that work. Here it will be sufficient to say that catalogue
entries should be as full in bibliographical particulars as the
means of the library will allow, and that notes, which must be
as brief as possible, should elucidate obscure titles, show the
qualifications of the author, his method, elementary or otherwise,
the preliminary knowledge required for the reading of the book,
its place in the literature of the subject, and the presence of
bibliographies, glossaries, etc.; and should give, in the case of
reprints, the date of first publication, and in that of revised
editions, the nature of the revision or editorial additions.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec259">259. Form of Catalogue.</h4>

<p><b>259. Form of Catalogue.</b>&mdash;Having chosen the manner in
which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
his catalogue is to be compiled, or, to adapt a term from classification,
its inner form, the librarian has an almost equally
important decision to make as to the manner of its outer form,
or the way in which it may be made accessible to his public.
At one time every librarian aimed to produce a printed catalogue
as a matter of course and necessity, partly because MS. forms
were imperfect, and partly because the universal prevalence of
the barrier system made a key of which every reader could have
a copy an integral part of the charging. This view does not
prevail to anything like the former extent, and the complete
printed catalogue in book form is becoming less and less general.
In some ways this is unfortunate, because the printed catalogue
has the indisputable value of book-form, homogeneity, and
convenience both for consultation and for carrying about;
besides, it is a valuable bibliographical tool for use in all other
libraries. At the same time, the great cost of the printed catalogue,
especially when issued complete in any of the alphabetical
forms, and the irritating fact that in a growing library
it is incomplete the day after it is published, have made it almost
impossible for public librarians to publish in this form. Complete
printed class-lists are a more satisfactory form, because
each class can be published separately and at such intervals as
will distribute the cost over several years; and revisions can
be made in similar serial manner, so that classes such as the
Useful Arts, in which books most rapidly run out of date or are
superseded, can be more frequently revised than others. Most
classified catalogues are issued in this manner. But, in spite
of the admitted advantages of the complete printed catalogue
in book-form, the tendency is to depend upon complete manuscript
catalogues at the library, and to advise readers of additions
by means of a periodical library bulletin, by duplicated lists, by
lists published in the local newspapers, etc. The open access
system has destroyed the most immediate necessity for the
printed catalogue&mdash;the choosing of books from a stock which
readers were unable to examine&mdash;and few libraries which publish
such a catalogue can hope to recoup even a substantial
part of the cost from sales. One or two libraries have a <i>selected</i>
printed catalogue, which contains the 10,000-20,000 invariable
books in the library&mdash;the classics in all branches of
literature<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
which readers have a right to expect to find on the shelves&mdash;and
depend upon MS. catalogues for the stock as a whole.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec260">260. Card Distribution, etc.</h4>

<p><b>260. Card Distribution, etc.</b>&mdash;In using the term &#8220;manuscript
catalogue&#8221; we speak somewhat loosely, in that the term usually
covers any catalogue not in printed <i>book</i> form; hence it covers
slip, card, sheaf, placard and various other forms in which
individual entries may indeed be printed. The most used of
these is the card catalogue, in which each entry of books is
made on a separate card, and the cards are arranged on their
fore-edges in drawers or trays (but drawers preferably) in the
order that would be used in a book-catalogue. The merit of
this system is its infinite flexibility; for, as every book has its
separate card, cards for additions can be inserted without dislocating
the order, and the catalogue can be kept up-to-date
always. Several of the great bibliographical and cataloguing
institutions have adopted this form, the most important being
the Library of Congress at Washington. This admirable library
not only prints its own cards, but offers copies for sale to other
libraries at a low cost. In 1914 these cards were available for
650,000 titles, and to these additions of from 50,000 to 55,000
are made annually. As the cards are of standard size (5 inches
&times; 3 inches = 12&middot;5 &times; 7&middot;5 cm.) they can be used in any properly
constructed catalogue. Naturally there is an emphasis on
American books, but thousands of the cards apply to English
books as well. Thus, for an expenditure of about two cents per
card, any library may have the cards for its catalogues, and
this is at a far smaller cost in labour and money than any individual
printed entry can be obtained by any library. The backbone
of the system is the &#8220;unit&#8221; card; that is to say, one card
is printed for a book and on it are indicated all cross-references,
etc., and extra copies of the card can, if it is thought necessary,
be purchased and placed under the headings indicated. The
Library of Congress issues advance proof sheets at a charge of
$30 a year, which may be cut up and mounted on cards as a
staff catalogue, or as suggestion slips, and from these may be
learned the serial numbers by which cards may be ordered.
In the United States several of the great city libraries act as
depots for storing whole sets of the cards, which librarians of
other libraries may consult instead of proof sheets. This card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
distribution method has thus been dwelt upon as it has as yet no
analogue in the United Kingdom, and it is to be hoped that some
judiciously chosen great British libraries may act as depots for
Library of Congress and other cards. Their use would save
thousands of pounds to British libraries, as well as set free for
other library purposes the hundreds of cataloguers in hundreds
of different libraries who are all engaged in the wasteful
task of cataloguing the very same books. Other libraries which
issue printed cards are the Institute International de Bibliographie
at Brussels, the Concilium Bibliographicum, Zurich, the
John Crerar Library, Chicago, and Pittsburgh Library. About
ninety per cent. of the municipal library books in the United
States are covered by the Library of Congress cards; therefore a
certain number of cards have still to be made by the individual
libraries; and in English libraries practically all the card catalogues
are so made. In some cases the cards are made by
mounting entries from the periodical list of additions or bulletin,
but usually the cards are written, hand-printed or typed. It is
obvious that some system of card distribution from an authoritative
centre is badly needed in the United Kingdom as a measure
of mere economy.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec261">261. Sheaf Catalogue.</h4>

<p><b>261. Sheaf Catalogue.</b>&mdash;The second form of manuscript
catalogue is the <i>sheaf</i>, which may be described as a book-application
of the principle of the card catalogue. It consists of a sheaf
or holder in the shape of a book-cover which is fitted with locking
rods designed to hold some 600 or 800 leaves. The leaves
are separate individual pieces of paper cut to a standard size
and punched with slots and holes to accommodate the locking
rods of the sheaf. The sheaf is arranged on much the same
plan as the card catalogue, except that several books are entered
on each page as a rule, and when any page becomes congested it
is re-written as a whole. It will be seen that this is the loose-leaf
principle, which has largely become so prominent in business
methodology; and, indeed, the sheaf-catalogue was undoubtedly
the forerunner of the loose-leaf ledger. It has most of the
advantages of the card catalogue, occupies less space, and has
the undeniable advantage of book form; but whereas in the
card catalogue there is little or no re-writing of entries, in the
sheaf catalogue this must be undertaken at intervals. Of course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
if one page were devoted to each entry, as one card is so devoted
in the card catalogue, the merits of the systems would seem to be
equal, except perhaps that the card is of a more durable material
than the paper used in the sheaf. But either card or sheaf is
infinitely superior to any other form of MS. catalogue.</p>

<p>A reference only is necessary to other forms of MS. which have
been proposed from time to time, as none of them has been
adopted by any number of libraries. The very old libraries
occasionally use a slip catalogue; the Bodleian and British
Museum, for example, paste slips into volumes or guard books
resembling large scrap-books in approximate alphabetical order,
and other libraries use similar methods. The system is a good
one in many respects; the public understands and likes it; but
the catalogue runs to so many large volumes that its accommodation
would be a serious matter for the ordinary library; and
the congestion of entries, with loss of all but approximate
alphabetical order at most letters of the alphabet, will be obvious.
Adjustments will be explained in the next chapter.</p>

<p>It is not the intention here to recommend any special method
or form of cataloguing; individual library systems have individual
needs; and no librarian should make so important
a decision as to the character of his catalogue without an
examination of such catalogues as have been named and
described. Our next chapter will illustrate the physical
forms of catalogue sufficiently, we think, for most practical
purposes.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec263">263. Anglo-American Code.</h4>

<p><b>263. Anglo-American Code.</b>&mdash;While the study of the above
codes and elucidations is a necessary preliminary to the best
cataloguing work, they all lead up in general to the Anglo-American
cataloguing code, which made its first appearance in
1908,<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
and at the time of writing (May 1919) is again under
revision. It is a useful and happy example of co-operation
between the two principal library societies of the world, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
may be said to have laid the foundations of all future cataloguing
method. It consists of definitions; 174 substantive
rules, with variations where the two countries could not agree,
and where some recognized authority such as the Library of
Congress differed from the rule recommended; and appendices
on abbreviations, transliteration, and sample catalogue cards
illustrating the rules. A digest and criticism of these rules,
which are too many to be copied here, will be found in Brown&#8217;s
<i>Library Classification and Cataloguing</i>, and will serve to show
the skeleton of the entries they provide, and will be serviceable
to the student who reads it in connexion with the Code
itself. The main feature of the Code is fulness of entry, involving
various repetitions in places; for example, the author&#8217;s
name, which is used as the heading, is also repeated in the title.</p>

<p class="hind2_4 blankbefore"><span class="smcap">Lecky, William Edward Hartpole.</span> The American
Revolution, 1763-83; being the chapters and passages
relating to America from the author&#8217;s <i>History of England
in the Eighteenth Century</i>, by William Edward Hartpole
Lecky.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Arranged and edited, with historical and
bibliographical notes, by James Albert Woodburn.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br />
<span class="padl2">Added</span> entry: Woodburn, James Albert.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">The example will give an idea of the general treatment of a
book and of the use of punctuation. The three dots have a
&#8220;separating&#8221; purpose merely. Rules that differ from some
in fairly general use are: 23, which prescribes that authors
shall be entered in full and in their vernacular form with certain
exceptions; 25, which enters compound names under the first
part of the name and refers from the other part,&mdash;thus: Burne-Jones,
Sir Edward, <i>not</i> Jones, Sir Edward Burne-; and in particular
33, which enters a nobleman under his family name and
refers from his titles,&mdash;thus: <span class="smcap">Thomson, William</span>, <i>1st baron
Kelvin</i>; <span class="smcap">Lubbock, John</span>, <i>1st Lord Avebury</i>. Authors who have
changed their names are entered under the earliest form, but
the later name is added to the entry,&mdash;thus: <span class="smcap">Smith, Hannah</span>,
<i>afterwards</i> Hesba Stretton; and married women are treated
similarly. Pseudonymous authors are entered under their real
names when they are known, with references from the assumed
names.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>It will be clear that, in view of the impossibility of printing
the Anglo-American Code in this chapter, it will be futile to give
an alternative Code in a manual which deals with the general
activities of the profession. A brief Code did appear in the last
edition, which was practical and simple, and reference may be
made to that, but it is strongly to be suggested that all future
catalogues should be accommodated to the A.-A. Code in order
that uniform methods of entry may be perfected, catalogues
may become more generally understandable, and a formidable
obstacle to co-operative cataloguing be removed.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec264">264. Bulletins.</h4>

<p><b>264. Bulletins.</b>&mdash;Since about 1894 a number of libraries have
issued periodical magazines, or bulletins, in which are printed
lists of new books, reading lists on special subjects, notes on the
work of the libraries, and other matter likely to be of use and
interest to library readers. The first use of such a magazine is
to supply readers with a regular supplementary catalogue of all
book additions; a second purpose is to publish notifications of
new rules or alterations in the working of the library; and a
third may be to issue information about the work accomplished
by the library. The greatest amount of space, therefore, should
be allotted to the description of new books, and annotations should
be supplied liberally to the entries which require them. The
magazine has the advantage over ordinary supplementary catalogues
in that it is issued regularly and frequently; and it has a
valuable purpose in supplying printed entries by means of which
the card or sheaf catalogue can be kept up-to-date effectively.
Copies of the magazine can be printed on thin paper (preferably
bank paper) on one side only, and the entries can be cut out and
mounted on cards or slips and inserted in the standard catalogue
of the library, whatever form it may take. Emphasis may be
laid upon the special catalogues or reading lists which can conveniently
be published by this means. A special catalogue is
usually a classified list of entries on the subject chosen in ordinary
catalogue form, of which several good examples appear in
the Norwich <i>Readers&#8217; Guide</i>. A reading list has a directive
purpose; it is in a much freer form as a rule, selects the
best books on the subject, and indicates the order in which they
may be read most profitably, with qualitative and elucidatory
notes. Examples of such lists appear in several American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
library bulletins, and examples readily accessible are those
in the Croydon <i>Reader&#8217;s Index</i>, a sample from one of which is
subjoined:</p>

<p>The cost of such bulletins varies according to style, variety
of types used, etc., and rarely can it be recovered from sales.
Some bulletins are wholly or partly supported by advertisements,
and when these are included it is better that they should be on
separated pages at the beginning and end, and not, as is sometimes
done, inserted in irritating manner amongst the library
matter.</p>

<p><b>265. Preparation of Catalogue Copy.</b>&mdash;The quickest and
most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
economical method of preparing catalogue copy for the printer
is to do it as perfectly as possible, according to set rules of typing
or handwriting, punctuation, type-marking, and revision. Irritations
innumerable pursue the librarian who allows copy to go
to the printer which leaves anything to the imagination or
discretion of that too often unjustly abused person; printers&#8217;
corrections are an alarming addition to the cost if they have not
been anticipated; and what is and what is not a correction has
always been a matter upon which author and printer have
rarely seen eye to eye. If the copy is fool-proof and composition-proof
the chances of corrections are reduced to the minimum,
although it is impossible to remove them entirely.</p>

<p>Separate entries should be made for each book on slips, of
uniform size to permit of rapid arrangement; and in most cases
the 5 in. &times; 3 in. paper slips used for suggestions will serve,
although where annotation is used to any extent the size is rather
too small for type- or hand-written entries. On these the entries
are made according to the rules in force, and if hand-written,
they should be according to a standard hand-writing. The
models given (<a href="#Fig91">Fig. 91</a>) are the best forms of hand-script that
have yet been devised, and every beginner in cataloguing should
be required to learn their use. If the slip is ruled horizontally,
with two vertical lines (a double margin) at the left side of the
slip, it will be easier to regularize every entry by commencing
the leading word or name at the first vertical line, the title at
the second, and leaving a horizontal line blank between the title
and the annotation. Every type distinction should be indicated
according to the standard rules for marking printing copy (see
Brown&#8217;s <i>Library Classification and Cataloguing</i>, p. 256, &#8220;printer&#8217;s
corrections,&#8221; which apply to the preparation of copy as well as
to its correction). Finally, all copy should be checked microscopically
before it is sent to the printer, even if it has been
written by the librarian himself or by the chief cataloguer. The
slips should be arranged in order and numbered, or they may be
mounted on sheets of paper in columns of about ten or twenty,
in order to prevent loss. Two proofs at least should be required
from the printer, the first in slip, or galley, form, the second in
page form; it is better to have three proofs, especially if
the catalogue has elaborate type distinctions, employs many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
abbreviations, etc. Moreover, the most minute reading of proofs
is necessary. It is really wonderful to what an extent errors
creep into proofs, and the practice of the printer&#8217;s reader who
went over every page of proof however perfect until he <i>did</i> find
an error, although it is a counsel of perfection, is suggestive of
what may be expected from the reader of catalogue proofs.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec266">266. Printing Specifications.</h4>

<p><b>266. Printing Specifications.</b>&mdash;Hints on printing specifications
relating to catalogues can be gained from Philip&#8217;s <i>The Production
of the Printed Catalogue</i> and from Quinn&#8217;s <i>Library Cataloguing</i>,
but the specifications there given must be adjusted to
the special kind of catalogue proposed. An excellent practical
method of obtaining estimates of cost is to have specimen pages
printed of the body of the catalogue and the indexes, exactly of
the required model, spaced out with the number of lines per
page. If the manuscript copy is not ready, estimates can be
obtained from the printers per page, according to the specimen
pages, and this is a fair way of tendering. If the copy is ready,
estimates should be obtained for the whole job, including covers,
in the style of the specimen pages. A printer can soon tell how<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
much print a manuscript will run to, especially if the copy has
been prepared in a uniform manner, with ten or twelve slips
mounted on the folio. A clear understanding as to payment
for corrections and additions to proof should be reached before
the tender is accepted.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec267">267. Co-operative Cataloguing.</h4>

<p><b>267. Co-operative Cataloguing.</b>&mdash;Efforts have been made from
time to time to obviate the duplicating of cataloguing work that
occurs all over the country, and in every country, and brief
reference should be made to these. The principal is the Library
of Congress card-distribution system, to which detailed reference
has been made. In Great Britain various attempts have been
made, but chiefly in the form of annotated and classified lists
of new books, which it was expected that libraries would transfer
to their own catalogues. Such lists were issued in <i>The Library
World</i> in 1901, but were discontinued for lack of support. Later
the Library Association issued such lists in <i>The Library Association
Record</i>, but in recent years this work, which is still done by
members of the Association, is published in the form of weekly
lists in strict catalogue form (Decimal classified, and annotated)
in <i>The Athen&aelig;um</i>; and <i>The Librarian and Book Selector</i> publishes
monthly annotated lists which are classified by both the
Decimal and Subject classifications. In America, <i>The A. L. A.
Book-List</i>, <i>The Wisconsin Library Bulletin</i>, and <i>The Ontario
Library Review</i> all provide similar lists. Any of the entries in
all of these is suitable for cutting out and mounting on cards
or slips for insertion in existing catalogues.</p>

<p>Other kinds of catalogue co-operation are those in which
more than one library has joined in the issue of a catalogue
to cover the stock of all in certain subjects. A small example
was the <i>Union Class-List of the Libraries of the Library and
Library Assistants&#8217; Association</i>, 1913; and larger examples are
the <i>Classified Catalogue on Architecture, etc., in the Principal
Libraries of Manchester and Salford</i>, 1909, which was edited by
Henry Guppy and Guthrie Vine for the Joint Architectural
Committee of Manchester; and the Newcastle <i>Classical Catalogue</i>,
1912, which contains certain periodicals and books in the
Armstrong College Library, as well as those in the Public
Libraries. The most recent examples are series of class-lists on
important subjects such as Internal Combustion Engines and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
Aeronautics, both 1918, issued by the Committee on Joint-Technical
Catalogues, Glasgow, which bring together titles from
the libraries of eighteen institutions in that city, indicating the
location of the various books by abbreviations added to the
entries, as:</p>

<p class="padl4 fsize80 blankbefore">Cassier&#8217;s Engineering Monthly. E. Kp. L. Ml. P. Pp. S. St. U.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">Many schemes for a national central co-operative catalogue have
been drawn up, and lie buried in the pages of library periodicals,
until some future time when the benefits of such work will be
realized and recognized in this country.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="title">MECHANICAL METHODS OF DISPLAYING CATALOGUES</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec268">268.</h4>

<p><b>268.</b> We have dealt already with forms of catalogue to some
extent, but the five chief methods of displaying manuscript
catalogues merit a more detailed consideration and illustration.
It is needless to attempt to describe every device which has
been introduced for the purpose of displaying catalogues and
providing for additions and expansion, and we shall limit our
selection to those which are best known, most effective or most
used. The five chief methods are the Page, Card, Sheaf, Placard
and Panoramic, a nomenclature suggested in an article which
appeared in 1893 in the <i>Library</i>, pp. 45-66.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec269">269. Page Catalogues.</h4>

<p><b>269. Page Catalogues.</b>&mdash;The most elementary form of the
page catalogue is the ordinary manuscript book, with stepped
thumb-index or simple alphabetical division of the leaves, so
many being allowed for each letter of the alphabet. This is
an unsuitable variety for a public library, and should not be used
for cataloguing purposes.</p>

<p>The British Museum public catalogue consists of large guard
books, in which printed or manuscript slips of book entries are
mounted on the tough cartridge paper leaves, so as to leave
space for additions. When a page becomes congested, the slips
can be lifted by means of a paper-knife, as they are secured
only at the ends, another leaf can be inserted on the adjoining
guard, and the old and additional slips can be redistributed over
the whole of the newly created space. This catalogue represents
but one alphabet, or copy of the catalogue, in some hundreds
of volumes, and each volume only holds a small portion
of the alphabet, as from Bal to Bec. One copy of the catalogue
thus serves many readers at one time. By distributing the
entries over a number of volumes, congestion is less likely to
occur than in catalogues complete in themselves in one or two
volumes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span></p>

<div class="figc400" id="Fig92">
<img src="images/illo277.jpg" alt="" width="376" height="550" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 92.</span>&mdash;Catalogue Shelves, British Museum (<a href="#Sec269">Section 269</a>).</p>
</div>

<p>A variation of this system of guard book is to be seen in some
public libraries where the whole of the catalogue is mounted in
one volume. A number of copies of this style of page catalogue
must be provided to meet public needs, and it is, on the whole,
a less serviceable and much more expensive form than the
catalogue on similar lines spread over a number of volumes. A
good example of this kind of page catalogue is to be seen in the
Mitchell Library, Glasgow, where it exists in the form of huge
guard books displayed on special stands.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec270">270.</h4>

<p><b>270.</b> To overcome the difficulty of inserting additional leaves
at pleasure in page catalogues, various kinds of adjustable
albums, with movable leaves, have been introduced. At the
Biblioth&egrave;que Nationale, in Paris, and elsewhere a catalogue
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
used consisting of thick, hinged leaves, punched at the back and
laced into the boards, or secured by means of a screw fastening.</p>

<div class="figc400" id="Fig93">
<img src="images/illo278.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="169" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 93.</span>&mdash;Adjustable Screw Binder (<a href="#Sec271">Section 271</a>).</p>
</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec271">271.</h4>

<p><b>271.</b> Another variety of this French binder designed to secure
adjustability of leaves is that shown below in the illustration
(<a href="#Fig93">Fig. 93</a>), wherein the leaves are clamped by the pressure of two
wooden slats, which are drawn together by means of two or
more endless screws turned by a key.</p>

<p>For this kind of binder it is necessary to notch the leaves to
correspond with the screws.</p>

<p>The principle of the sheaf binders (<a href="#Sec282">Section 282</a>) can also be
applied to page catalogues, and very successful page books have
been made up from the form illustrated in <a href="#Sec286">Sections 286</a>-<a href="#Sec287">87</a>.
The most recent methods of loose-leaf ledgers have also great
possibilities for catalogues, and are probably to be preferred to
any book manuscript type other than the sheaf.</p>

<p>The whole of the devices just described are so arranged that
leaves can be inserted, to a more or less limited extent, at any
point. The British Museum type does not provide for unlimited
additions, nor for any subsequent division of volumes, without
much trouble and rebinding. The French and other adjustable
leaved binders do allow for unlimited insertions, subject to the
condition that the matter mounted on the pages must be redistributed.
In an adjustable book new leaves can be inserted
at any place till the volume is full, and then the contents may
be divided and two books used, this subdivision and spreading
being continued as the entries increase in number.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec272">272.</h4>

<p><b>272.</b> A form of page catalogue combining the powers of
inserting new leaves at any point, and moving single entries
about without having to paste them down or lift them up, is
called the Rudolph Indexer. It consists in its book form of
thick cardboard leaves, to which metal flanges are secured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
down each margin. Each leaf is provided with a double-hinged
fastening, which enables it to be hooked on to any adjoining
leaf, so as to form a volume of any desired thickness, to which
a pair of covers can be attached. The catalogue entries are
written or printed on narrow cards, and these are slipped under
the flanges, which secure them by either end. <a href="#Fig94">Fig. 94</a> shows
at a glance the appearance of this form of page catalogue.</p>

<div class="figc600" id="Fig94">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 94.</span>&mdash;Rudolph Indexer Book (<a href="#Sec272">Section 272</a>).</p>
</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec273">273.</h4>

<p><b>273.</b> There are certain advantages claimed for page catalogues
which may be enumerated here. The chief is that a
large group of entries can be scanned with one sweep of the
eye, thereby facilitating the rapid finding of any particular
entry. Another is that, being in book form, it is more easily
manipulated than other forms of catalogue. Its comparative
cheapness is sometimes put forward as an advantage over other
forms, particularly cards, but on this point it is not wise to
assume cheapness where so much time and labour are necessarily
involved. As regards the claim to rapidity in turning up
entries because a whole page is exposed at a time, there are
considerable doubts as to its soundness. General experience
of such catalogues as the British Museum is that, owing to the
number of entries, the occasional congestions and disorders
where double columns of entries exist, it is more difficult to find
a given entry than in the case of cards or slips properly guided
and in accurate alphabetical order. This point may be further
illustrated by the case of men or women who are not adepts at
using alphabetical lists, and who turn up a particular word in a
dictionary with much difficulty and loss of time.</p>

(<a href="#Sec275">Section 275</a>).</p>
</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec274">274. Card Catalogues.</h4>

<p><b>274. Card Catalogues.</b>&mdash;The card-index is the invention of
librarians, and is perhaps the most important contribution to
method that commerce owes to them. Cards for library cataloguing
purposes were used in France in the middle of the
eighteenth century; they were used in Trinity College, Dublin,
early in the nineteenth century; and in 1852 they were introduced
into the Bank of England for commercial indexing. The
plan of keeping cards or slips on edge in boxes or drawers loosely,
thereby giving unlimited means of expansion and intercalation,
must have occurred to many minds as the best means of
maintaining perpetual alphabetical order. Single cards not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
attached in any way, save temporarily, possess unlimited powers
of movability, and can be arranged in any kind of order when
assembled in numbers, because each card can be taken away
or moved about or fresh cards added at any point in a
series, without upsetting any adjoining card, or interrupting
alphabetical order.</p>

<p>The cards, when arranged in alphabetical order, are separated
into small divisions by means of projecting guides, on which are
printed subject or author or other words or class numbers, which
serve the same purpose as the running catch-words of a dictionary,
only they are much more effective, because more conspicuous.
They are secured by means of a rod which passes through holes
punched in the lower part of the cards, and the rod is either
locked or screwed into the back or front of the drawer.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec275">275.</h4>

<p><b>275.</b> The usual plan is to store the cards in the drawers of a
cabinet, marking the contents of each drawer plainly on the
outside. <a href="#Fig95">Fig. 95</a> is an illustration of a card cabinet, showing the
usual guides and sliding runners to enable the whole extent of
a drawer to be pulled free of the cabinet for purposes of
examination.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec276">276.</h4>

<p><b>276.</b> Another form, which is illustrated above (<a href="#Fig96">Fig. 96</a>),
shows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
various improvements, including an adjustable angle-block, for
supporting the cards at a suitable angle for easy consultation:
this can be screwed up tight at any point in a drawer, so as to
hold a smaller or larger number of cards in place; a special
form of rod on which the cards are strung or filed, easily removable,
but still capable of safeguarding them against misuse or
misplacement; a special automatic catch at the front of the
drawer to prevent it being pulled out accidentally, but which
does not prevent any drawer from being taken away from the
cabinet if required. Another important improvement introduced
in 1902 was the modification in the sides of trays, whereby
the woodwork was cut down so as to lighten the tray and enable
the cards to be handled from the sides as well as the top. This
variety is known as the &#8220;Sideless Tray&#8221; (<a href="#Fig97">Fig. 97</a>).</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec277">277.</h4>

<p><b>277.</b> The card catalogue in cabinets of fixed drawers is not,
in some ways, such an effective arrangement as detachable
trays or drawers stored in a suitable rack or cabinet. The
fixed-drawer plan has various disadvantages, chief among which
is the serious one that a single person consulting a cabinet may
monopolize from 6000 to 10,000 entries, according to the number
of drawers forming a tier. Where there are four to six drawers
in a tier it is impossible to adjust them so that both tall and
short persons will find them equally accessible; and only a few
persons can use the catalogue at one time, as two persons will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
practically cover up three tiers, thus in some cases cutting off
from other users at least 20,000 or more entries. There is also the
difficulty of filling up application forms for books, as no proper
writing surfaces are available, although some modern cabinets
have a horizontal shelf which slides in and out as required from
the centre or from beneath the cabinet, as shown in <a href="#Fig95">Fig. 95</a>.
In addition there is the difficulty of obtaining a good light on the
lower drawers, and the large amount of space occupied by a
large cabinet. To meet these difficulties card cabinets should
be placed most carefully so that the person of average height
can consult all drawers without trouble; and the extension shelf
just mentioned should be provided; or, the cabinets should
stand upon a table the top of which projects in front of them
sufficiently to permit of drawers withdrawn from the cabinet
being placed upon them. This shelf or table provides the
desired writing surface; and small paper note-blocks on which
readers can note catalogue particulars are part of the table
equipment.</p>

<p>When printed entries are mounted on blank cards, it is advisable
to &#8220;guard&#8221; them, in order to balance the additional thickness
of the upper part, which causes bulging, by pricking the
fronts of the cards, or embossing them by means of a blunt awl,
thus:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/illo283.png" alt="pricked and embossed card" width="450" height="130" />
</div>

<p>A similar result may be obtained by pasting strips of paper
of similar quality to that on which the printed entries are mounted
on the lower part of the back of the card.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec278">278.</h4>

<p><b>278.</b> Various kinds of trays, described and figured below, are
intended to replace the &#8220;cabinet&#8221; system; but it is clear that
if every drawer is easily detached from a cabinet and if suitable
table space is available their advantages are more theoretical
than real. A good form, which is well safeguarded and not too
heavy or clumsy, will be found in a tray which is provided with
all necessary accessories in the form of locking-rod, guides,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
adjustable angle-block, outside label-holder, and felt pads to
prevent it from scratching table-tops or other furniture. This
kind of tray can be kept in racks of a convenient size, and users
can remove it to a table for consultation.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec279">279.</h4>

<p><b>279.</b> A French form of card-catalogue tray was invented by
Mr F. Bonnange, of Paris, in 1866, and improved in 1874. In
this, the method of securing the card differs from the rod
threading through perforations, as in English and American
models. The cards are hinged, and have shoulders formed in
the slightly thicker lower portion, as shown in the illustration
(<a href="#Fig98">Fig. 98</a>), which is also slotted to clear the fastening. The
hinged cards shoulder into side grooves formed in the wooden
trays, and the slotted portion is placed astride a powerful endless
screw, which traverses the tray from end to end, and carries a
suitable block which acts as a travelling clamp. The screw is
worked by means of a key, and when turned to the right the
block travels forward along the screw till the cards are all firmly
clamped between it and the end of the tray; when turned to the
left the block travels back and so releases the cards to enable insertions
to be made. The upper portion of the cards being hinged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
and consequently free of the block, are not clamped, and can be
turned over readily for purposes of consultation. Guides, alphabetical
or numerical, may be inserted either above or at either
side of the cards.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec280">280.</h4>

<p><b>280.</b> An Italian card tray on a somewhat similar principle to
this was invented by Mr A. Staderini, of Rome, in 1890. It
differs from the Bonnange tray in having a sliding-block gearing
with a ratchet which is fastened along the bottom and made to
engage or disengage with a key. The cards are similar in principle
to those of the Bonnange system, save that the lower hinged
half is not slotted. The illustration (<a href="#Fig100">Fig. 100</a>) will explain better
than words the appearance and other accessories of this tray.</p>

(<a href="#Sec280">Section 280</a>).</p>
</div>

<p>Both the Bonnange and Staderini methods share in common
an advantage of some importance, viz., the clamped lower portion
of the card forms a counterfoil to show what has been
taken, should a card by accident or design be removed or torn
off. The accession number or brief title of the book can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
written on the clamped portion of the card, and so will safeguard
against loss and imperfections. This is an advantage
not possessed by any of the ordinary card methods, because
when cards are torn from the rods they leave no trace, and
become lost for ever, leaving it very problematical whether a
catalogue is perfect or not.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec281">281.</h4>

<p><b>281.</b> A card catalogue on a somewhat similar principle to
the French and Italian forms just described is known as the
Duplex Card Catalogue, and was invented in England to enable
both sides of the cards to be used, thereby considerably enlarging
the capacity of the catalogue, while materially reducing
its bulk. It is fitted with falling ends which act as angle-blocks;
a travelling angle-block can be adjusted and locked at any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
point; a locking-rod for threading the cards upon in order
to secure them; and xylonite label-holders. The cards are
larger than ordinary catalogue cards, and instead of being
hinged are simply creased at a short distance above the rod
holes. This gives a slight bulge and enables the cards to have
the necessary play. The trays are held lengthways in a position
parallel to the body, instead of at right angles as in the case of
ordinary trays, and the cards or leaves are simply turned over
like those of a book.</p>

methodology is Sayers and Stewart&#8217;s <i>The Card Catalogue</i>.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec282">282. Sheaf Catalogues.</h4>

<p><b>282. Sheaf Catalogues.</b>&mdash;The sheaf catalogue is not so widely
used as the card system in Britain, but, as we have shown, it has
exactly the same advantages as regards the power of expansion
and intercalation. It aims at combining the advantages of both
book and card catalogues, by dividing the catalogue into handy
sections so that the maximum number of readers can consult
it at one time; providing means for continuous expansion
in alphabetical order; safeguarding the contents of sections;
reducing the amount of storage space occupied; and enabling
users to handle and turn over the catalogue like the leaves of
an ordinary book. The introduction of ordinary paper slips,
which can be used in any typewriter, which can be easily stored
in various forms of binders in book form, and which can be added
to in manuscript without undoing the holder, is a real economy
in library administration which has not received the attention
it deserves. While 1000 entries in a card catalogue will occupy
from 750 to 840 cubic inches of space, the sheaf-holders most in
use will not take up more than fifty-six cubic inches of space
for the same number of entries. The writing surfaces are also
much larger.</p>

<p><b>283.</b> The slip catalogue known as the Leyden, from its first
use in the University Library of Leyden, in Holland, in 1871,
consists of bundles of slips, notched as shown in the illustration
(<a href="#Fig102">Fig. 102</a>), and secured by means of cord or catgut. The outer
boards are hinged, and notched to correspond with the slips,
and the cord is tied firmly round the volume and into the slots,
so as to bind the whole. These Leyden holders are only adapted
for private or staff use, and must be kept in very thin sections,
as the volumes get more loose and insecure the thicker they are
made. As a means of holding any kind of temporary slip, this
is, however, a useful device.</p>

comprises a fixed back and boards, to which two iron screw-bolts
are attached. On these the slips, which are perforated to correspond
with the bolts, are threaded, and the books are secured by
means of brass screw-caps which fasten the boards to the bolts,
and so make the volume rigid and the slips secure. These
volumes are numbered and kept in pigeon-holes, which bear the
volume numbers and letters denoting the section of the alphabet

on to two upright rods, which are kept in place by means of a
sliding bar which, when screwed into place, locks the slips and

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec286">286.</h4>

<p><b>286.</b> The most used and oldest of the British sheaf catalogues
is the &#8220;Adjustable Catalogue-Holder,&#8221; which was invented
about 1892. This has a flexible leather back, and the slips are
bound and unbound by the contracting and expanding action<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of two cylindrical screws, turned by means of a metal key. It
is not necessary, as in the case of all other sheaf-holders, to undo
this one in order to remove the slips when additions are being
made, the loosening of the screws being all that is necessary.
The slips are punched at the back edge with bayonet-shaped
or keyed slots, which give sufficient holding power when the
screws are tightened to clamp the boards and slips into one solid
and firm volume. The book numbers, if written on the clamped
portion of the slips, will remain in the sheaf if entries should be
wilfully torn out, and no catalogue could be rendered imperfect
without the knowledge of the librarian. Xylonite label-holders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
are attached to the back of this form of sheaf, which enable contents
labels to be changed at will, without pasting or damaging
the back. A rack or pigeon-holes can be provided in which to
store these sheafs in numbered, alphabetical or class order.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec287">287.</h4>

<p><b>287.</b> The most recent form of catalogue sheaf is that illustrated
in <a href="#Fig107">Figs. 107</a>-<a href="#Fig108">8</a>. It differs from the adjustable in having
a rigid back, and but one screw. In other respects it is perhaps
easier to manipulate than the binders just described.</p>

<p>The holder consists of a strong wooden back to which two
stout covers are attached by means of hinges, specially designed
to guard against injury to the covers. Within the holder a
special form of brass screw-fitting is mounted, upon which the
slips are threaded, so that when the covers are closed the whole
sheaf is firmly secured by means of a special screw. A few
turns of the key suffices to lock or open the holder.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec288">288.</h4>

<p><b>288.</b> A very good way of maintaining a sheaf catalogue for
public use, especially in open access libraries, is to provide a
sheaf or sheaves for each class of literature, and to enter the
books in class order, using both sides of the slips for entries of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
small topics. These sheaves can be kept on the shelves with
their classes. To this an author and title index can be provided
in one alphabet, each author being kept on one slip or more,
and both sides of the slips being used to ensure economy of
space, and enable readers to find at once any particular book.
Thus, on the front of the slip an author entry might appear as
in <a href="#Fig109">Fig. 109</a>, while on the back, or reverse side, the titles would
be continued as on <a href="#Fig110">Fig. 110</a>.</p>

<p>The matter of strict alphabetical order in such index slips is
of little consequence, owing to the concentration of entries which
enables a consultor to note the contents with one sweep of
the eye.</p>

<p>Title entries can be done in similar fashion, the leading word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
being used as the index or catch-heading, as in <a href="#Fig111">Fig. 111</a>.
Here, again, strict alphabetical order need not be maintained,
owing to the comparatively small compass in which the entries
are displayed.</p>

<p>The classified sheaves can be kept in the same manner, or,
if it is felt that a separate slip should be written for each book,
to ensure strict order, this of course can be done. But it is at
best doubtful if this is necessary save in very large subjects.
For example, entries like the above are quite easily discovered
(<a href="#Fig112">Fig. 112</a>).</p>

<p>Where annotations on a large scale are employed, it is best
to make use of a separate slip for each entry.</p>

</div>

<p>In all kinds of sheaf catalogues a fair margin should be allowed
round the entries, to preserve them against finger-marks.</p>

<p>The slips are punched so as to secure absolute uniformity in
size and in the position of the holes. The hole being made in
an oval form allows the slips to be easily threaded on, or removed
from the screw-fitting.</p>

<p>The special construction of the holders prevents the slips from
sagging or drooping at their free ends, a fault observable in both
the Staderini and Sacconi forms. It is usual to &#8220;guide&#8221; all
forms of sheaf or slip catalogues, by boldly writing catchwords
on both outer corners of each leaf (see <a href="#Fig109">Figs. 109</a>-<a href="#Fig110">10</a>, <a href="#Fig112">112</a>), and
indicating the contents by means of the xylonite label-holders
on the backs.</p>

<p>The whole subject of sheaf-cataloguing methodology is explained
and illustrated in Stewart&#8217;s <i>The Sheaf Catalogue</i>.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec289">289. Placard Catalogues.</h4>

<p><b>289. Placard Catalogues.</b>&mdash;The most ordinary form of placard
catalogue is a manuscript or printed list of books on a large
sheet or sheets, which is framed and hung on the wall where
readers can see it. There are several varieties of these framed
lists, which are used chiefly for lists of additions. A form giving
the power of moving single entries has been devised in England
which is better than anything else usually seen. This consists
of a frame with a movable back, on which vertical xylonite slips
are fastened in such a way as to form long columns with flanged
sides. Under the flanges can be slipped pieces of cardboard the
width of the columns, which slide up and down in the length of
the column as required. The titles of new books can be written
on these cards and arranged in any order. If blank cards are
left between every letter of the alphabet or every class, additional
entries can be added at any moment. If several frames are used,
some hundreds of new books can be catalogued, and when full
the entries can be transferred to the printed bulletin, or otherwise
utilized, to free the frames for further additions. The <a href="#Fig113">illustration</a>
given above will show the nature of this adjustable accessions
catalogue, which corresponds in principle with the adjustable
Periodical List.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="title">FILING AND INDEXING</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec300">300. General.</h4>

<p><b>300. General.</b>&mdash;Although the library invented the card index,
it may be confessed that in this country the library has not yet
realized the possibilities of its own invention, even if it is convinced
of its complete desirability. We make no question, however,
of the fact that such methods as card-indexing and its
derivative, vertical filing, become more necessary every day if
the librarian is to handle with any degree of success the multiplicity
of documents, prints, papers and other disparate matter
which form so important a part of the stock of a really living
library. Since the publication of the second edition of this
<span class="smcap">Manual</span> the whole matter has made such advances that a complete
reversal of many of the statements and recommendations
made in it is necessary. The general indexing and filing problems
before the librarian are these:</p>

<ul class="nostyle">

<li>1. Borrowers&#8217; register.</li>
<li>2. Stationery and supplies register.</li>
<li>3. Correspondence filing and indexing.</li>
<li>4. Indexing of minutes.</li>
<li>5. The filing of clippings.</li>
<li>6. The filing of broadsides, prints, photographs, maps, lantern
slides, negatives.</li>
<li>7. The filing of deeds.</li>
<li>8. The filing of pamphlets.</li>

</ul>

<p>As the index is the key to the filing system, we will treat of
filing methods first.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec301">301. Vertical, and Loose versus Other Methods.</h4>

<p><b>301. Vertical, and Loose</b>, <i>versus</i> <b>Other Methods.</b>&mdash;Any rigid
method of filing becomes confused and time-wasting. For
example, the old method for correspondence sent out was to copy
it in a letter-book which was equipped with a thumb-index. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
all letters so copied were placed in the book in chronological
order, it necessarily happened that correspondence with a given
person or on a given subject was found in several separate places
in the book; and, although the letters received which occasioned
the correspondence could be pasted into the letter-book against
the replies, no connected view of the correspondence could be
gained without several references. The letter-book method
served its purpose for a long time, and has been preserved owing
to the conservatism which is a British characteristic and to fear
of loss, misplacement, or inaccurate record being made. Experience
proves, however, that loss and misplacement can easily
be prevented, and accurate record of
letters is equally possible, when filing
by flexible methods is used. Moreover,
the principle of classification&mdash;alphabetical
or subject&mdash;is the foundation
of successful filing which admits of
rapid reference and completeness; for
it is beyond question desirable that
all correspondence, documents, etc.,
relating to any given matter, should be kept in one
place only. For example, the bookbinding transactions of
a library involve correspondence with several bookbinders,
specifications, instructions, orders, incidental correspondence
respecting defects, errors, etc.&mdash;and all this material should come
together for the simple reason that it is used together. To
ensure this the material must be filed individually as a general
rule; that is to say, in such a way that additional material can
be inserted. There are various methods: the Stolzenberg file,
for instance, and other files which resemble it. These are
generally folders of stout manilla, having two flexible prongs
inside at the fold which penetrate and fold over the margins of
the papers and so hold them in place; and when an insertion
is made the prongs are lifted and the new paper fitted into position.
More recent is loose filing in folders in which the material
is not secured in any way, and insertions are therefore possible
without obstruction of any kind. All folders are filed in drawers,
in cabinets as a rule, and the average office desk is now equipped
with drawers for vertical filing. An illustration of a folder and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
filing cabinet will show better than much description what we
have in mind (<a href="#Fig114">Figs. 114</a>, <a href="#Fig115">115</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 115.</span>&mdash;A Drawer of a Correspondence Filing Cabinet.</p>
</div>

<p>In these folders correspondence and other documents are
filed together with the carbon copies of replies. The carbon copy
of a letter is, of course, an exact facsimile of it made at the one
original operation of writing or typing the letter; it is thus an
exact record, and additions or corrections are easily visible.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec302">302.</h4>

<p><b>302.</b> The arrangement of correspondence, etc., is a matter
upon which opinion differs, but except for general correspondence,
which may be filed alphabetically in folders&mdash;one or more
folders as required being devoted to each letter of the alphabet&mdash;it
is generally found that a classified arrangement is to be preferred.
Even in the alphabetical folders an expansible number
should be given to each folder in order that it may be indexed
briefly and clearly. For the classification of correspondence
several schemes have been devised; that, for example, in the
latest edition of Dewey&#8217;s <i>Decimal Classification</i> is full, flexible and
practical; and perhaps that which is most used is L. Stanley Jast&#8217;s
<i>Decimal Classification of Library Economy and Office Papers</i>, 1906
(revised 1907). The main divisions, a subdivision, and a section
of the complete tables will enable us to illustrate its use (see <a href="#Page_284">p. 284</a>).</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec303">303.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>303.</b> Everything that comes into the library or goes out of
it, except the actual books, will fit into such a classification, and
may be numbered and indexed by it. All correspondence is
marked boldly with the number of the division to which it
belongs, and is filed in the folders which bear the number.
The folders are numbered on the projecting edge of the broader
flap, as shown in <a href="#Fig114">Fig. 114</a>, and are arranged numerically according
to the notation order. It may be objected that this method
separates letters from one correspondent who may write at
various times or on various subjects; but experience proves that
except in few cases, such as are provided for under 55, where
general correspondence is arranged alphabetically under the
names of the writers, the questions the file is required to answer
are not answered in terms of names of correspondents; moreover,
the alphabetical name index, which is an indispensable
accompaniment of the method, brings together all references
to letters from any given correspondent. The index should be
on cards, and should give the name and address of the correspondent,
the classification number of the subject, and the dates
of the letters received or dispatched (see <a href="#Fig116">Fig. 116</a>).</p>

<p>Not only does this index serve as a key to the correspondence
file (<a href="#Sec302">Section 302</a>); it may contain, without prejudice to its value,
all addresses which the librarian deems it expedient to keep,
with telephone numbers, telegraphic addresses, and cable codes
where necessary.</p>

<p>It will be obvious that a classified file of this kind will accommodate
all other documents and lists&mdash;book-lists, reports made
on subjects or departments, minutes, and in fact any miscellaneous
papers whatsoever.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec304">304.</h4>

<p><b>304.</b> The effectiveness, and indeed safety, of any individual
indexing or filing system depends upon the care with which it
is manipulated in order that misplacements of papers or cards
may not occur. The fear of carelessness or ignorance on the
part of assistants has caused some librarians to prefer an alphabetical
system of filing. When this is so it should be alphabetical
by subjects, except in the case of general correspondence which
deals with no particular subjects. Library communications are
frequently of this general nature, but the vital letters are upon
subjects; for example,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<ul class="nostyle">

<li>Exhibitions,</li>
<li>Lectures,</li>
<li>Readings,</li>
<li>Story Hours,</li>

</ul>

<p class="noindent">are headings taken at random for which folders would be included.
In arranging courses of lectures, for example, a librarian may
write and receive any number of letters; and he wants them
together as a rule and not in the alphabetical order of correspondents.
This alphabetical-subject system requires an index
to such folders as do not come under general correspondence;
folders coming under the latter would be most useful in a sequence
separate from the subject folders, but such separation is not
essential.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec305">305.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>305.</b> If either of the two methods outlined is deemed too complex&mdash;neither
is so really&mdash;the old theory that &#8220;the only natural
arrangement for letters is an alphabetical one&#8221; will rule the
choice of method. This simply means arrangement alphabetically
by the name of the correspondent, and in this method the
file is self-indexing to the extent of the names. If it is made
the rule to place letters from institutions under the names of
such institutions, and to insert, where necessary, in strict alphabetical
order slips of paper to hold all cross-references from the
names of officers, there will be no need for further indexing.
If topical indexes are required they can be compiled on 8vo slips,
the subject word being written boldly on the top of the sheet,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
and the names of the writers on the topic in alphabetical order
below. These slips can take their place in alphabetical order
among the letters.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec306">306.</h4>

<p><b>306.</b> All working correspondence files should be weeded out
at intervals to remove matter of transient interest and to relieve
congestion. The librarian should at the first mark such papers
as are to be filed&mdash;much correspondence is merely formal, and
has no information value, and need not be filed even temporarily;
but it is better to file everything and to weed frequently
than to lose any important document by initial carelessness.
When weeding out, the matter of merely temporary interest may
be destroyed; and that which it is desired to keep may be
transferred in strict order to filing boxes, or another storage
filing cabinet, thus leaving the current files free from any but
current matter.</p>

<p><b>307. Prints, Photographs and Maps.</b>&mdash;Unframed, unmounted
&#8220;illustration&#8221; material, in which are included prints, illustrations,
photographs, maps, and broadsides, requires separate and
careful filing. In the first place it should be, so far as possible,
mounted on &#8220;nature,&#8221; &#8220;sultan mecca,&#8221; or similar mounts of
uniform size. This applies particularly to prints and photographs,
and is the best means of ensuring their preservation
and ease in handling and consulting them. They then need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
close classification by one of the existing systematic schemes to
line on so far as may be with the classification of the books; and
it is often necessary to expand a classification considerably to
differentiate the almost innumerable sub-topics which may form
the subjects of pictures. Such expansion is skilled work and
should be done only by an expert classifier. An examination
of the classification proposed for local photographic surveys in
Gower, Jast and Topley&#8217;s <i>The Camera as Historian</i>, 1916
(Sampson, Low), will show how minute a classification photographs
demand. Each mount should bear a label, in the top left
corner preferably, giving the class-number, the subject, and other
particulars (see the sections on Photographic Surveys, <a href="#Sec433"><b>433</b></a>, etc.).
The filing may be in classification order in boxes which will lie
flat on the shelves; and the most economical boxes are those made
of the stoutest material compatible with lightness, such as cardboard
covered with rexine, pegamoid cloth, etc.; heavy boxes
of wood are awkward to handle and should be avoided. Better
than boxes, because of the ease of consultation and insertion
permitted, is a vertical file in drawers. In this the prints are
inserted loosely like cards in a card-index, and no lifting and
little handling are necessary to find any given print. For vertical
filing the mounts should be the stoutest available, and a
further protection is to use folders to hold groups of prints&mdash;one
to a topic as a rule. The projecting edge of the folder may
bear the topic number.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec308">308.</h4>

<p><b>308.</b> Maps do not fit readily into the vertical system, and are
troublesome material as a rule. Several solutions of the map-filing
problem have been suggested&mdash;rolling them and inserting
them in tubes in a cabinet on the principle of the umbrella stand;
mounting them on spring rollers and fixing them over bookcases
where they can be drawn down to be consulted exactly as
a blind is drawn; and an ingenious method devised by Mr G. T.
Shaw, and described in <i>Public Libraries: their Organization, etc.</i>,
1918 (Library Association), is worth examination. For the
many small maps that all libraries possess, flat filing in such
boxes as <a href="#Fig118">Fig. 118</a> depicts is probably the best. Single sheets
of the Ordnance Survey, or other similar maps which are much
handled, should be mounted on linen or some similar material,
and an additional protection from tearing is to bind them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
tape, which may be done by folding the tape over the edges and
running them round with an ordinary sewing machine.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec309">309. Newspaper Clippings.</h4>

<p><b>309. Newspaper Clippings.</b>&mdash;The vertical file is an excellent
instrument for dealing with newspaper clippings. These, in the
case of matters of temporary interest, may be dropped into classified
folders. For clippings which it is desired to keep, it is better
to provide a mount, which may be of paper of sufficient substance
to bear them, and paste them down, writing in the top left corner
the class-number, subject, source and date of the clipping. The
older methods of filing clippings in newspaper-cuttings books, or
in any form of guard book, have the disadvantage of inflexibility,
want of rational means of indexing the contents, and
occasion reference in course of time to several volumes for
matter on any subject.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec310">310. General.</h4>

<p><b>310. General.</b>&mdash;For most filing purposes quarto folders, to
accommodate quarto papers, which file in standard-sized drawers,
are sufficient; but both drawers and folders can be obtained in
foolscap and other sizes. And notwithstanding our advocacy
of the loose method of filing, there is much to be said for such
files as the Stolzenberg for papers which have an invariable
chronological appearing and are valuable in that order; because
the file, having the apparatus already described for securing and
binding the papers, has the never-to-be-discounted virtue of
book form. Such papers are minutes, periodical reports on
special departments, financial analyses, book-lists, etc. Moreover,
although the standard Stolzenberg cabinet accommodates
its folders in horizontal fashion, the latter are also suitable for
filing vertically in the drawers recommended for general purposes.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec311">311. Lantern Slides and Negatives.</h4>

<p><b>311. Lantern Slides and Negatives.</b>&mdash;Modern libraries collect
and preserve, occasionally even make for their own use, lantern
slides and negatives. The method recommended for storing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
these is precisely similar to that for prints; that is to say, in
drawers in cabinets of suitable dimensions. Such cabinets are
made by several firms specializing in photographic apparatus;
and drawers can be obtained of a size to accommodate either
slides or negatives. Without being dogmatical upon the point, it
may safely be said that the best arrangement of slides is a
classified one in drawers, the classification number being written
on a label on the mount of the slide and on the top edge of the
binding. If the slide is made from a negative in the possession
of the library the number of the negative should also appear
on the mount.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec312">312.</h4>

<p><b>312.</b> Negatives require more careful treatment, as the film is
subject to damage if unprotected. They are also generally
larger than lantern slides; and separate cabinets, or separate
drawers, are desirable to hold them. A useful method is to
insert each in a small manilla folder bearing the number on its
edge, which number should also be written in ink (white is best)
on the corner of the negative. Negatives may be arranged by
accession numbers, as they are rarely wanted more than one at
a time; and the slide catalogue will refer from slide to negative,
as well as be a direct reference to the latter.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec313">313.</h4>

<p><b>313.</b> The index or catalogue of slides may be on cards arranged
as a rule by titles or subjects, as the photographer or slide-maker&#8217;s
name is rarely wanted. The following example of a
card shows the title, source, location, and classification number
of a slide and the number of its negative:</p>

<p class="blankbefore">Slides which form lecture sets and are invariably used together,

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec314">314. Indexes.</h4>

<p><b>314. Indexes.</b>&mdash;Probably no work demands the use of indexes
so imperatively as library work. The catalogue is merely an
extension of an index, and the borrowers&#8217; register (which is dealt
with in <a href="#Sec366">Section 366</a>, etc.) is in its most convenient form merely an
index. We have already dealt with the indexes for <a href="#Sec302">correspondence</a>,
<a href="#Sec311">lantern slides</a>, etc., and it will be more convenient to deal
with the indexes to prints and maps in <a href="#Sec438">Sections 438</a>, etc. Here
we can mention only one or two administrative indexes, with
the general remark that the methods described are not to be
regarded as stereotyped, but are merely suggestions which
librarians may adapt to their special needs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Card Diary.</span>&mdash;A useful little card index is one which
may go on a desk, and is guided with the days of the week, and
has such other guides as &#8220;This Week,&#8221; &#8220;To-day,&#8221; &#8220;Next Week,&#8221;
&#8220;Miscellaneous matters,&#8221; etc., which serves as a reminder to its
user. Behind the appropriate guide are filed cards referring to
the matters which are to be dealt with at the time indicated.
These card-diaries are commonly known as &#8220;ticklers,&#8221; and can
be a most effective aid to methodical administration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stationery and Supplies Index.</span>&mdash;It is an important matter,
especially in large libraries, to be able to put hands immediately
upon any article of stationery or other supplies. The old, haphazard
plan of thrusting supplies in cupboards with wooden
doors, and trusting to luck or memory for finding them again,
is too leisurely a method for the busy modern librarian. All
storage cupboards or presses should have glazed doors. This
simple precaution has the effect of inducing tidiness on the part
of the staff, and the prospect of slovenly arrangement is reduced
to a minimum. The next process is to decide upon a method of
indexing which will offer the greatest facilities for rapidly finding
any given article. In the <i>Library World</i> for July, 1899, Mr
Jast describes a graphic method of achieving this end. He
provides a series of cards of uniform size, one or more for each
article indexed, according to the need for indexing them more
than once in the alphabet. On these cards he draws a rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
diagrammatic elevation of the cupboard or other place of
storage, as illustrated (<a href="#Fig120">Fig. 120</a>).</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 120.</span>&mdash;Supplies Location Card (<a href="#Sec314">Section 314</a>).</p>

<p class="blankbefore">On this is indicated at the top left-hand corner the class-number,
and name or nature of the supply, and at the opposite
corner its location. When a supply is stored away in this
receptacle one of the blank cards representing it is headed as
described, and the exact place where the articles are stored is
indicated by a cross marked on the <a href="#Fig120">diagram</a>, as shown above.</p>

<p>Of course, every separate receptacle must have its own series
of specially drawn cards. The index is made by arranging these
cards in the alphabetical order of the names of the various articles.
Any one wanting a new fine receipt book, and not knowing where
to find it, would look up this index under the word &#8220;Fine&#8221; and
there he would find the card which indicates not only the receptacle
where these books were stored, but also the exact position.
This card may be combined with the inventory card described
in the next chapter (<a href="#Sec327">Section 327</a>).</p>

<p>Another plan would be to mark every cupboard or other
receptacle with a letter or number. As these places would have
glass doors, if they had any at all, there would be no necessity
to mark separate shelves or pigeon-holes further. It is not always
possible, or even desirable, to fix the location of supplies beyond<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
the main receptacle. A reference to a cupboard is quite near
enough for any one having eyes in his head. To these various
receptacles an index on cards or slip books as before can readily
be made. The card should bear the name of the article at one
of its top corners, and on the opposite corner the number or
letter of the place where it is to be found. If necessary the
remainder of the card or slip can be used for setting out the
dates and quantities of successive orders of the article. This
will be found a very useful form of inventory.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec315">315.</h4>

<p><b>315.</b> The indexes of minute books are usually kept in the
books themselves and not separately. If a thumb index has
not been provided, a few pages, say, twenty-six, may be reserved
at the beginning or end of the book, in which an alphabetical
sequence can be spaced out in pencil. It is equally clear, for all
the reasons given in favour of the individual entries, that cards
permit, that these indexes may be made on cards.</p>

needing remedy); the location and distribution of keys when
the latter are in the hands of several people; classification
decisions; and, indeed, there is no limit to the use of the card
index as an administrative tool. One simple and invaluable
index in libraries where lectures are given is a Lecturers&#8217; Index,
with guides for Offers, Next Series, Current Lectures, Past<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
Lectures, behind which are placed cards bearing the names and
addresses of lecturers, the titles and other particulars of their
lectures, dates of delivery, etc. The mere indexing of such
materials affords many suggestions and reduces lecture-organization
to a very simple process.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="title">STATIONERY AND RECORDS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec322">322. Forms and Blanks.</h4>

<p><b>322. Forms and Blanks.</b>&mdash;Most of the important forms and
blanks have already been described and figured under the
different departments to which they refer, and this section will,
therefore, only deal with a few general forms. <span class="smcap">Notepaper</span> of
various kinds should be provided, some in the ordinary business
size, some post quarto, and some foolscap folio. On each of
these sizes the usual heading should be printed, with the arms
and name of the town, librarian&#8217;s name, and any other information
thought necessary. All ordinary correspondence can be
carried on with the business size, but official and complimentary
letters should be written on the larger sizes. <span class="smcap">Envelopes</span> to
suit the various sizes should also be procured, and it is a good
plan to stock some large-sized manila envelopes for sending off
large documents, reports, etc. These can be had in a variety
of sizes, and some of them have clasps instead of gummed flaps,
which make them very useful for temporary filing purposes.
Gummed postal <span class="smcapall">WRAPPERS</span> should also be stocked in a fairly
large size, and <span class="smcapall">LABELS</span> for sending off parcels, with the name of
the library boldly printed on them, will be found very useful.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec323">323. Writing Materials.</h4>

<p><b>323. Writing Materials.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Inks</span> are manufactured in such a
variety of kinds and colours that choice is made difficult. A
good black ink should be procured, and also a bright red colour.
Copying ink is not necessary even where press letter-copying is
employed, as ordinary blue-black ink, if not blotted but allowed
to dry naturally, will make perfectly good press copies. Care
should be taken not to dry the tissue-paper leaves of the letter
book completely when making copies. Other colours of inks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
such as green, violet, etc., can be obtained if wanted for special
purposes. <span class="smcap">Ink-wells</span> should be got in the modern reservoir
form, with a constant level dipping place. Ink kept in such
receptacles never gets thick or dirty, and the pen is never overcharged
or underfed. These ink-wells with rubber tops can be
obtained for about one shilling each, but for staff and committee
use a better variety should be ordered as the rubber degenerates
quickly under the chemical action of the ink. Ink-wells should
preferably be associated with pen-<i>racks</i> rather than with pen-trays.
A rack sorts the pens and pencils out automatically in
a visible order, while a tray wastes a large amount of time
annually, owing to the groping and examining and fruitless
fumblings necessitated before the right pen or pencil is found
among its fellows. One pen one place, is a good motto for any
librarian. Of course the <span class="smcapall">FOUNTAIN PEN</span> removes a great deal
of the waste of time and trouble inseparable from ink-pot filling,
pen selecting, pen dipping, etc., and every librarian ought to
have one as part of his ordinary equipment. There are various
sorts in the market, but the higher priced ones are, as a rule, the
only reliable ones, and the cost is an investment on which a return
is soon made. <span class="smcap">Stylographic pens</span> are very useful, but because
of their tendency to spoil good handwriting, they are not so
satisfactory as fountain <i>pens</i>, although they are much cheaper.
For staff use in the numbering of book labels, charging, etc.,
stylographic pens would be found very useful, and every library
of reasonable size should stock a few.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pencils</span> for public use should be the ordinary cedar ones
at about 5s. a gross. For note-book copying purposes a
Rowney &#8220;H&#8221; pencil, retailing at twopence, will be found of
great value, as it does not &#8220;set off&#8221; like the ordinary &#8220;H-B.&#8221;
A hard pencil lasts much longer than a soft one, it does not
require pointing so often, and the fact just mentioned, that
writing done by its means does not blur or &#8220;set off&#8221; is an advantage
not to be despised. Red and blue crayon pencils should
be kept for checking purposes. Ordinary pen-holders and hard
and soft pen-points are occasionally stocked in public libraries,
as well as pencils, to lend out to the readers. Where this is done
a certain amount of loss will have to be faced, as pens and pencils
both disappear in the most mysterious ways. It is, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
a very great convenience to provide pens, especially in reference
libraries fitted with special reading-tables provided with sunk
ink-wells.</p>

<p>Blotting paper, foolscap paper ruled faint, scribbling pads,
and common white paper in sheets about 15 inches &times; 9 inches
for mounting slips, should be provided among the writing

special stationery, typewriting carbon, and stencilling papers,
inks, etc. Most libraries of even medium size now employ a
skilled stenographer who acts as secretary to the chief librarian,
manages the correspondence filing, the duplicating work, copies
catalogue cards, etc. The best typewriter is the cheapest
machine in the long run, and it should be equipped with carding
and tabulating apparatus. Those which have more than one
fount of type, as roman and italic, large and condensed types,
have much to recommend them. A duplicating machine is an
invaluable accessory. For small libraries the flat stencil-duplicating
machine, such as the Gestetner, will suffice, and
probably the best copies of smaller work, card forms, etc., are
obtained by this means. But for circulars, book-lists, programmes
and other matters of which many copies are required
a cyclostyle is desirable. By its means topical reading lists
and the many circulars which a live library desires to issue
almost every week can be prepared and circulated widely with
the utmost dispatch. Such a machine is one of the best investments
a library can make.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">This inventory does not prevent supplies from running out
suddenly, and thereby producing undesirable misunderstandings.
There are many ways of effecting this check, all more or less
satisfactory, but none, perhaps, is quite so certain as an actual
material check upon the running-out of supplies. In addition
to the inventory it is necessary to establish an &#8220;emergency-supply&#8221;
cupboard, safely locked up, and in it to place a small
stock of everything which is liable to run out. Thus, if two
reams of foolscap arrive, a five-quire packet must be taken from
it, separately parcelled up, and deposited in the emergency-supply
receptacle. Attached to this emergency bundle should
be a luggage label, or other conspicuous tag, bearing the words
&#8220;Foolscap, ruled faint, order No. 69, Stock exhausted.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;
The blank space is for the date when the emergency supply is
transferred to the ordinary stock cupboard. In course of time
the accessible stock is used up, and the person who removes
the last sheet, or the one who next goes, discovers the shortage,
and is forced to ask the key-keeper of the emergency cupboard
for the reserved stock. This is produced, the label is dated
and handed to the person responsible for ordering a fresh supply.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec328">328.</h4>

<p><b>328.</b> All general library <span class="smcapall">KEYS</span> may be assembled on a special
key-board. This should consist of a large board fitted with the
necessary number of hooks, one for each key or group of keys,
and a proper descriptive label and number should be pasted
under each hook. The keys should be numbered and labelled
to correspond, with ivory labels attached by rings to every key.
In addition an alphabetical list should be fixed to the door of
the key-board, so as to facilitate finding. In some libraries
the departmental heads and assistants are provided with a
master-key to all internal doors which concern them; but keys
which give access to the building as a whole should be limited
to the chief librarian and the chief caretaker. A large building
requires many keys, and a card-index, entering of the name of
each key and the person who holds it or its location, is a useful
method of checking the safety of keys. When keys are removed
from the building, they should be insured with one of the key
insurance or registry offices.</p>

<p>There are several minor matters of routine or arrangement
not dealt with in other places. Dusting is usually underdone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
in British libraries. For one thing there is rarely a sufficient
supply of cloth dusters; often a dirty one, stowed away in a
drawer, is all the provision for a large library. Clean dusters
should be attached by means of rings or clips to every bookcase
and cupboard throughout a library, and the staff should be
required to use them on every possible occasion. Certainly a
book should never be handed to a reader in a dusty condition,
as not only may the reader be offended, but he must inevitably
transfer the dust from the outside to the inside of the book in
handling it. There would be much less dust among book-shelves
if a liberal supply of dusters were allowed and constantly used.
When books are being dusted systematically a large tray or box
of wet sawdust should be provided. Into this the books should
be dusted by means of a brush.</p>

<p>It is also a good plan, whenever possible, to take very dusty
books out to the open air, and smartly beat them together, two
at a time. This drives the dust out more effectually than anything
else. Vacuum cleaners which work by means of suction are
sometimes useful in cases where large accumulations of dust
require to be removed, and not simply redistributed, but a
powerful variety is necessary as the smaller vacuum cleaners
remove the top layer of dust as a rule, and leave a solid substratum.
Wood block and linoleum covered floors when treated
with wax polish do not require to be scrubbed, and the surface
remains smooth, and cleaning is reduced to a minimum. There
are various floor preparations which are said to be effectual in
keeping down dust, but most of them produce discoloration in
the course of time, and periodical scrubbings should be arranged
to restore the original colour of the flooring.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="title">BOOKBINDING AND REPAIRING</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec329">329. General.</h4>

<p><b>329. General.</b>&mdash;Public library binding is an art by itself, and
is quite distinct from ordinary commercial bookbinding on the
one hand, and artistic binding on the other. A binding which
is strong enough to withstand the handling of its owner and his
friends, and beautiful enough to please the taste of the fastidious
amateur, may be practically useless in a position where it may
have to endure the handling of hundreds, or even thousands, of
different persons, all of whom are not equally educated in the
proper use of books. A public library book requires to be bound
neatly and strongly, with particular regard to the integrity of
the stitching rather than to its mere covering, although this has
to be considered in the case of much-used reference books.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec330">330.</h4>

<p><b>330.</b> For public library work only good binders who are
experienced in this particular class of bookbinding should be
employed. In many cases, especially in small towns, the work
turned out by local binders is about as bad as it can well be,
and just as likely to lead to the rapid destruction of books as
to their preservation. Cheapness does not in this matter necessarily
mean economy, nor is good workmanship often an accompaniment
of low prices. It may be said generally that library
binding is one of the items of maintenance which no library can
<i>afford</i> to have done cheaply and badly. It is much better, in
the long run, for a library in a small provincial town to send its
work to a recognized bookbinder in a large town, and even to
pay carriage both ways, than to depend upon the local bookseller
or stationer, who only knows about the casing of magazines.
A good binder will bind a book in a manner which will
enable the boards to outlive the leaves, while a poor workman
will require to have his work done over again very soon, if,
meanwhile, his rough and unscientific methods have not tended
to shorten the existence of the book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span></p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec331">331.</h4>

<p><b>331.</b> The question of binding books from the sheets, or rebinding
cloth- and paper-board books in leather, before putting
them in circulation, has been much debated, though it is really
not a very formidable or difficult matter after all. As no one
can foretell with certainty whether or not any given book is
going to be popular and much used, it is manifestly a mistake
to have any book re-bound, or specially bound from the sheets,
until this very important point has been ascertained. Time alone
can determine whether a book is going to be popular, and for this
reason there seems little economy or gain in specially binding new
books at the outset. Books in publishers&#8217; cloth bindings, when
printed on paper of fair quality, will often circulate from twenty
to forty times before attaining a condition which requires re-binding,
and when strongly and properly rebound in leather or other
boards will outlast the book. Some claims have been advanced
with regard to the durability of various styles of binding, but
it is impossible to ignore the fact that it is the paper of the book
and not the covers of the binding which forms the weak point.</p>

<p>The Great War has rendered this paper problem an
acute one. For a few years before 1914 librarians had
induced a few publishers to produce some classes of books
on a superior paper, and in a reinforced binding&mdash;that is,
one according to the Society of Arts and Library Association
recommendations&mdash;but the war conditions not only stopped all
this, they prevented the importation of paper and paper-materials.
Hence the most appalling rubbish was made to serve
the purpose of book-paper, with disastrous results for almost all
books published from 1915-19. Few books published in that
period are in materials that will last without any particular use
for a decade, and far fewer will stand the handling of public
library readers or bear re-binding in any material heavier than
cloth. The public acquiesced in these materials as a war necessity;
it has yet to be seen if the publishers, having found the public
apparently contented with them, will persist in their use when
they become cheaper. Every effort must be made to prevent it.</p>

<p>Dirt is also as potent a factor as rough usage in shortening
the life of a book, and it really matters little what kind of
special materials or stitching are employed since no book&#8217;s existence
can be prolonged beyond a certain term of years when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
dirt and inferior paper are such important elements in the matter.
There are other factors in the question of binding from sheets,
and one is the difficulty of obtaining the necessary copies from
publishers. Another is the fact that some cheap novels cannot
be had in quires at all, and, consequently, any advantage which
may result from unused sheets giving a better and firmer hold
for stitching cannot be obtained. The durability of new books
re-bound in special materials has been somewhat exaggerated,
and librarians and committees should first adopt the ordinary
method of allowing use to determine the books which require
re-binding. But experiments should also be tried with special
re-binding and other plans in order to ascertain what is best;
and a good general rule will probably emerge&mdash;no book should
be bound so well that the cover is in excellent condition long
after the inside has been worn beyond redemption.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec332">332.</h4>

<p><b>332.</b> It would be a valuable concession if publishers would
issue some copies of every novel by well-known authors, printed
on specially tough paper, and bound according to the specification
given in <a href="#Sec341">Section 341</a>. This would meet every need which
exists for specially bound copies of popular books, and give the
much more valuable advantage of editions printed on paper
which is not mere rubbish.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec333">333. Home Binding.</h4>

<p><b>333. Home Binding.</b>&mdash;The question of establishing a bookbinding
plant, for the purpose of conducting binding on the
library premises, is one which affects only the large libraries of
the country; but large towns with a number of branch libraries
may find it both economical and advantageous to establish
binderies, if not for extensive operations in the binding of books,
at least for their repair and re-casing. At Portsmouth, Hull,
Bristol, Brighton, Bournemouth and elsewhere home binderies
more or less extensive have been established, and the experience
gained in these places seems to vary considerably.</p>

<p>The advantages accruing to the home bindery are obvious,
apart from that of the convenience of having the work done on
the library premises; the librarian can select only the best
materials and can supervise the work at every stage of the processes.
Librarians who have established such a department are
convinced not only of its convenience but also&mdash;a much more
important point in present circumstances&mdash;its economy. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
it is remembered that much other work than the actual binding
and re-casing of books, such as illustration-mounting, ruling,
magazine cover-making, etc., may be carried out in the home
bindery, there is much to be said for it; but until the experiment
has been carried much further home binding is not
advocated save in the larger libraries. A joint-stock or cooperative
bindery could be worked by the London Metropolitan
Borough Libraries with considerable prospects of success and
economy, but in isolated provincial towns the plan is not so
feasible.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec334">334.</h4>

<p><b>334.</b> Repairing departments stand upon quite another footing,
and here there is safe ground for experiment with every
prospect of success. At Glasgow, Manchester, Croydon, Islington
and other places, small repairing plants have been in operation
for some time with good results. At all the places mentioned
women workers are employed, who repair and re-case
books, stitch pamphlets in covers, and even bind less important
books which are not likely to be greatly used. Lettering and
numbering can also be done, a useful branch of the bookbinder&#8217;s
art, carried on at a considerable number of libraries. A repairing
plant such as is used at Croydon costs less than &pound;30, while the
wages of a repairer may range from 40s. weekly. Materials
also run into a certain sum per annum, according to the nature
and amount of work done.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec335">335.</h4>

<p><b>335.</b> Finishing, which includes lettering and numbering, can
be done by members of the library staff, although instruction
is sometimes difficult to obtain owing to trade jealousy and the
regulations of most polytechnic schools, which, though supported
by public funds, deny instruction to any save those
actually engaged in particular trades. Perhaps the day will
come when library schools, such as that about to be established
in London at University College, will include this subject when
dealing with bookbinding, typography and all allied practical
arts. A complete finishing plant, including sets of numbers and
alphabets, can be purchased at a sum which even small libraries
can afford. The satisfaction of accomplishing on the premises
the work of class lettering and numbering, which requires both
care and neatness, is great. At any rate, inquiry should be
made by librarians into the possibilities of establishing a
finishing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
department, especially in cases where a systematic classification
is used.<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

&#8220;Specification for the fittings of a small bindery,&#8221; by F. J. Williamson,
in <i>Leather for Libraries</i>, 1905.</p></div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec336">336. Materials.</h4>

<p><b>336. Materials.</b>&mdash;For public library purposes book-covering
materials should be of the most durable sorts, and it is not
wise to employ many different varieties either of cloths or
leathers. Ordinary binders&#8217; cloth is nearly as satisfactory as
anything else for preserving its colour, lettering and defying the
pernicious effects of gas-laden atmospheres and extremes of
temperature. It will not stand much handling, however, and is
very liable to wear out at the corners and joints. Nevertheless,
for little-used collections of pamphlets, sets of local publications,
and other matter which merely wants binding for appearance&#8217;s
sake and storage purposes, ordinary binders&#8217; cloth is strongly
recommended. Smooth varieties are preferable to rough or
patterned kinds, as being less liable to harbour dust. Apart
from ordinary binders&#8217; cloth, the best known varieties are linen
cloths, buckrams and Pegamoid and Rexine cloths. Pegamoid
and Rexine cloths are treated in a special way with some preparation
of celluloid to render them impervious to dirt and
moisture. For novels and other short-lived books these cloths
are worth a trial, as they cannot be regarded as expensive. At
any rate, experience has proved that these materials will outlast
any novel which may be re-bound in them, and, after all,
that is as much as can be expected of any binding. Leather
should rarely be placed upon little-used books, and many
libraries which hitherto used it for long sets, have discarded
it in favour of legal buckram, or such a material as Winterbottam&#8217;s
washable cloth. A certain amount of handling is
necessary for the preservation of most leathers, as the animal
grease from the hands is a preservative, and they deteriorate if
this is not forthcoming.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec337">337.</h4>

<p><b>337.</b> The principal leathers used for public library bindings
are pig-skin, persian and levant moroccos, and roan. Calf,
russia and other fancy leathers should not be used, as they turn
brittle under the influence of heated and dry air, and crumble
to pieces. Apart from this, they are costly and otherwise unsuitable
for public library purposes. The leathers recommended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
should be used according to the books which they have to cover,
and the following list will give an idea of the best classes for
which to use each kind<span class="nowrap">:&mdash;</span></p>

<p class="hind1_3 blankbefore">Levant morocco, or real morocco, made from goat-skin.
This material should be used for very valuable books
which require a handsome and dignified binding. It is
very durable, but expensive for ordinary work.</p>

<p class="hind1_3">Persian morocco, made from sheep-skin, is not so dear or so
good as levant morocco, but is a durable and satisfactory
leather if a good quality is procured. It should
be used for popular books in the non-fictional classes of
the lending department. Heavy books can be bound in
this leather, but pig-skin is better. The more it is handled
the better it wears and keeps its condition.</p>

<p class="hind1_3">Roan is a kind of inferior sheep-skin, with a different grain
and surface from Persian morocco, and is a useful and
cheap leather for certain classes of books, such as the less
popular works of travel, science, theology, fiction, etc.
Books up to the crown octavo size can be half-bound in
this material at prices ranging from 1s. 6d. to 2s. a
volume. Heavy books are not recommended for binding
in this leather.</p>

<p class="hind1_3">Pig-skin is the strongest leather of all, and also the most
durable for much-used heavy books; but librarians
should make certain that real pig-skin is supplied, and
not some wretched imitation. The price of pig-skin is
rather more than good Persian morocco. All reference
works, such as dictionaries, atlases, directories, and other
volumes which are being constantly handled, may well
be bound in this.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">All leathers specified for bookbinding should be of the acid-free
description recommended by the Society of Arts Committee
(1898-1900) and the Sound Leather Committee of the Library
Association. Sumach-tanned leathers are now to be had with
a special guarantee from the makers.</p>

<p>Other binding materials, such as vellum, parchment, canvas
and patent leathers of various kinds, are seldom required in
libraries, and need not be considered further. Preparations for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
spreading on books to protect them may also be passed over,
and also the continental and American habit of covering all
books in manilla or other paper covers of uniform colour. Most
of the so-called leather &#8220;preservatives&#8221; are hurtful rather than
helpful, but it may be observed that some leather bindings
which get dry and worn will improve if treated with ordinary
vaseline. It should be rubbed well and plentifully into the
texture of the leather with the fingers, and when it has soaked
in, should be wiped with a soft cloth. Vaseline is as good as
any patent or other preservative for reviving decaying and
shabby leathers of all kinds, although it dries quickly, and furniture
polish has also been recommended. As regards covers,
the time has not yet come when the individuality of a book, as
issued by its publisher, or given by its appropriate library binding,
requires to be hidden under a paper mask.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec338">338. Class Colours.</h4>

<p><b>338. Class Colours.</b>&mdash;In systematically classified libraries there
is a certain amount of advantage to be gained by re-binding each
class of books, as required, in some appropriate colour. When
open access to the shelves is also granted, there is a very considerable
aid to the maintenance of order given by the use of
distinctive class colours. Thus, Science may be light brown or
fawn colour; Fine Arts, orange; Social Science, light green;
Theology, etc., black; History and Travel, dark green; Biography,
maroon; Philology, light blue; Poetry, red; Fiction,
dark brown; and Juvenile, yellow; and so on to any degree. A
variation of this plan is to vary the colours for authors, binding
each distinctively; this gives a not unpleasing variety to the
shelves and has a certain arranging value.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec339">339. Lettering and Numbering.</h4>

<p><b>339. Lettering and Numbering.</b>&mdash;When lettering and numbering
have to be done apart from the re-binding, they can be
executed by the staff after a little practice, as pointed out in
<a href="#Sec335">Section 335</a>. The object of lettering is to facilitate the finding
of books, and for this reason it should be clear and bold. It is
also possible by means of a little variation to obtain a certain
amount of class-guiding in the system of lettering, and it should
be made an invariable principle in every public library to adopt
a certain order of particulars on the backs of books, and stick to
the order. Too often this important matter is left to the fitful
fancy of the binder&#8217;s finisher, with the result that very
frequently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
the author&#8217;s name appears in all the panels in rotation.
The series of suggestions given in <a href="#Fig127">Fig. 127</a> for dealing with each
class is offered as a basis on which any librarian can build a
system of his own. The letterings are arranged to provide for
titles, authors, volume numbers, class numbers, and dates of
publication when necessary. Class letters and numbers occupy
one definite place on each book, which is not subject to variations
in height when appearing on books of different sizes. The
markings here figured for the backs of books are arranged so
that titles occupy the leading panel in all classes and thereby
correspond with the great majority of the books as issued by
publishers.</p>

(<a href="#Sec339">Section 339</a>).</p>

</div>

<p>The chief points to emphasize in these suggested letterings
are that the class letter and number should always occupy the
same relative position irrespective of the size of the volume,
namely, about two inches from the foot, and that alphabetical
classes like Fiction, Poetry and Essays should be boldly lettered
with the first three letters of the author&#8217;s surname, or numbers
from an author table, while <i>Individual</i> Biography only should
be similarly marked with the surname letters of the <i>subject</i> of
the biography, but not the author, save in the case of autobiographies,
letters, etc. If it should be thought necessary to
add the accession numbers, they can be placed out of the way
in the top half-panel, as shown in <a href="#Fig127A">No. 7</a>, while shelf colours for
open access can be added at the points suggested in <a href="#Sec243">Section 243</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span></p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 128.</span>&mdash;Specimens of Class Lettering and Numbering
(<a href="#Sec340">Section 340</a>).</p>
</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec340">340.</h4>

<p><b>340.</b> The principal alternative method is that mentioned in
the chapter on classification (<a href="#Sec241">Section 241</a>), where the book is
lettered in accordance with what is thought to be the natural
process in arranging and finding books. Thus a book is arranged
on the shelves first by its class, second by its author, third by its
title, except in the case of individual biography, where the name
of the biographee takes the panel which in other books is devoted
to the author, and the author takes the panel below the title.
<a href="#Fig128">Fig. 128</a> will indicate sufficiently the appearance of such a
lettering scheme, and will show how it subordinates ordinary
usage to library purposes, especially in the third example.</p>

<p><a href="#Fig128">No. 3</a> brings Dowden&#8217;s book into the group of Shakesperian
books, and shows the spelling of the name preferred in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
catalogue for the heading; and <a href="#Fig128">No. 4</a> shows the method of
indicating both the real name of the author, which is the catalogue
heading and arranging name, and also the author&#8217;s
pseudonym.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec341">341. Specification.</h4>

<p><b>341. Specification.</b>&mdash;Whether or not library binding should
be done by tender, which in practice means giving the work to
the lowest bidder, is a question which different places must
settle in different ways. Sometimes tenders are insisted upon
by the municipality for all work done with public funds. It
must be recognized, however, that binding is a very varied matter,
some books requiring special treatment, and that binders are
equally varied in their ability to do special work. The best
results can only be obtained if the librarian has power to
send certain classes of work to the firms best qualified to deal
with them. So far as general binding is concerned, the present-day
combination of master-binders has levelled up prices
until every binder quotes practically the same figures; so there
does not seem much to be gained by tenders, except that legal
formality which is so much approved by public authorities. If
it is used, bookbinding specification should include every point
which has any bearing on the cost, finish and workmanship of
the books. The specification of the Society of Arts and that
drafted by Mr Douglas Cockerell are very good, and many of
their points could be included in a specification for library binding.
As requirements differ in every library, it is impossible
to attempt the drafting of a model specification which will meet
every case, but the details set out in the following draft may
prove useful and suggestive:</p>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>342. Records and Checks.</b>&mdash;When a lot of books for binding
is sent out it must be accompanied by a set of instructions to
the binder, and a copy of this must be retained at the library as
a record and to check the books when returned. The most
usual plan is to send out a binding sheet, ruled as in <a href="#Fig129">Fig. 129</a>, on
which are entered the particulars of the books requiring binding.
These particulars are also entered in a binding book, ruled
exactly the same as the sheets, and in the last column of this the
books are marked off as returned. This result, and an actual
facsimile copy, may be obtained by using a duplicating book,
the sheet sent to the binder being so perforated as to be easily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
removable. The double copying involved in making out two
separate sheets is thus avoided. It is usual to make the binder&#8217;s
messenger check over and sign for every lot of books at the end
of the page. Another method, which possesses the advantage
of enabling the binder to distribute the work in his workshop,
and makes every book carry its own instruction, is as follows:
Procure a large book of perforated slips, with a counterpart page,
unperforated, behind every page of slips, in the style of a manifold
order book. Have these pages ruled as in <a href="#Fig130">Fig. 130</a>, and
progressively numbered.</p>

<p>Or separate order slips, as under (<a href="#Fig131">Fig. 131</a>), can be used, and
their purport briefly entered in a binding book ruled to show title,
class and date returned, with a column for a consecutive number,
which of course would be written on the corresponding slip.</p>

The object of the progressive number is to afford a ready means
of identifying instructions and ascertaining in an easy manner
the number of books bound in any one year. These numbers
may also be written in ink at the end of the letterpress of each
book, as a means of ascertaining how often any book has been
re-bound. The price, if carried into the column reserved for the
progressive number in the counterpart, will also be a useful
record to keep. By simply referring to the progressive numbers
it is possible to ascertain the price paid for successive re-bindings,
and to keep a check on the whole of the work.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec344">344. Miscellaneous.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>344. Miscellaneous.</b>&mdash;Tape or ribbon <span class="smcapall">BOOK-MARKS</span> are sometimes
placed in public library books, but a much more obvious
and useful plan is to print a special book-mark with a folding-over
tab, which can be placed in <i>all</i> books which are issued, and
not confined simply to those which are re-bound. A good form
of marker can have one or two pointed rules for the due care
and preservation of books printed on a conspicuous part.</p>

<p>Some enterprising firms give away book-marks of various
kinds, many publishers insert advertising cards which serve as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
markers, and occasionally an advertising agent will supply a
library with book-marks, and pay for the privilege, on being
allowed to use some part of it for advertisements from which he
draws the revenue.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec345">345.</h4>

<p><b>345.</b> Special <span class="smcapall">END-PAPERS</span> have been introduced in a few
libraries to be placed in re-bound books. They serve the purpose
of an ownership mark more effectually than a book-plate,
but, of course, they can only be used in the books which happen
to require re-binding. The Croydon end-paper is quite an
elaborate design, giving compartments showing the arms, monogram
and a view of the town hall. End-papers of this kind are
a luxury which few public libraries can afford.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec346">346.</h4>

<p><b>346.</b> An effective way of placing an indelible mark of ownership
upon a public library book is to impress a blind stamp upon
the outside front board. This can be done by means of a screw-press
and a special die, and need not cost more than &pound;10. Any
member of the staff can impress such a stamp, and it is better
than confining this mark of ownership simply to books which
have been re-bound. A circular stamp is best, as it will always
appear straight.</p>

<h2>DIVISION X<br />
RULES AND REGULATIONS</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="title">RULES AND REGULATIONS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec348">348. General.</h4>

<p><b>348. General.</b>&mdash;-A public library is an institution based upon
broad lines of mutual co-operation, in which every citizen has
equal rights, and in which the rules should be drafted to protect
the common proprietary rights, without penalizing any
section of the community. Hence the liberal attitude which
recognizes that the whole purpose of librarianship is to get books
used must be brought to the drafting of rules. Fortunately this
attitude is becoming more common, if it is not universal, and the
whole tendency of modern public library work is to break down
all barriers between the readers and the freest use of books.
Indeed, it is better to lose a few books yearly than to protect
them from the very few dishonest people who may live in the
community by means which militate against the liberty of
readers.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec349">349. Hours.</h4>

<p><b>349. Hours.</b>&mdash;The number of hours during which municipal
libraries should remain open to the public will vary according
to the local conditions, staff and funds of every town and district.
In small places, with scanty populations and little libraries with
but one attendant, a few hours open at night on several days in
the week, according to requirements, will serve every practical
purpose. In towns of a fair size, of say from 10,000 to 30,000
people, the reading rooms should be open all day uninterruptedly
from 10 to 9 or 10, but the lending library need only be kept open
from 10 to 2 and from 5 to 9. In large towns of over 40,000
inhabitants, the libraries should remain open all day from early
morning till late at night&mdash;say from 8 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> till 10 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> for newsrooms;
9 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> till 10 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>
for reference libraries; 10 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> till<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
9 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> for lending libraries; and 4 till 8 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> for juvenile departments,
if any. There should be no interruptions, at any rate so
far as departments other than the lending library are concerned,
to these services, either in the way of half- or whole-day closing
to suit the staff, or any irregularity in hours. The public library
is a bureau for the supply of information, and should be found
open at any time in a working-day, during which people are
likely to use its resources. In large towns there is no necessary
connexion between the public hours and the staff, and in an
important matter of this kind, which affects the convenience of
hundreds of people, the policy of employing extra assistance, in
order to keep the library open all day and every day without
overworking the staff, should not be questioned. It may be
argued that if one town of a certain size can keep its public
libraries open all day and every day (save Sundays and holidays,
of course), every similar town and all larger ones can easily do
likewise. But, as may be seen by reference to Greenwood&#8217;s
<i>British Library Year Book</i>, 1900-1901, this is not invariably
the case. A careful and well-constructed time-sheet will often
get over difficulties which may seem to arise from under-staffing
or other conditions. There have been, and possibly still may be,
libraries in which, largely because of badly constructed time-sheets,
the assistants are given only one evening off weekly,
and work from eight to nine hours daily, although the library
is closed for a half-day every week, and thus both assistants and
public are incommoded.</p>

<p>At the same time, to dogmatize upon the question of hours is
unwise, as local circumstances condition the question so much.
Moreover, the recent movements in the industrial and commercial
worlds are in the direction of reducing working hours, and most
people are now at liberty before 7 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, a fact which does away
with the <i>necessity</i>, if not the convenience, of keeping libraries
open to the late hours until recently in vogue. Again, a suburban
library, with a population which returns from a neighbouring
city in the evenings, has need to be open later than one, say, in
the city itself. The whole matter is one of public convenience,
and if it is remembered that to have the library used to its fullest
limit is the ideal, the hours will be chosen well. At the same time,
there are always readers who prefer to use the library in the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
hour of the day, whatever that hour may be. If the closing
hour is nine, they will arrive at 8.45; if eight, at 7.45, and so on;
it is a curious, not uncommon human trait, which may be borne
in mind when hours are being arranged.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec350">350. Age Limits.</h4>

<p><b>350. Age Limits.</b>&mdash;There are wide differences in the practice
as regards the limit of age from which persons are allowed to use
the libraries, but within recent years the opinion on this point
has undergone considerable change. Formerly persons under
eighteen and sixteen were forbidden the use of public libraries;
now such high limits are very uncommon, though fourteen is
still frequently seen in the rules of otherwise progressive libraries.
Of course, local conditions must receive due consideration in this
matter, though it is difficult to think of any circumstance which
calls for any distinction being made between children of twelve
and those of fourteen years of age. There are hundreds of bright,
intelligent lads and girls of twelve who are the equals in knowledge
and ability of their fellows of thirteen and fourteen years
of age; in fact, children do not fit, intellectually, into age-compartments;
their capacities are surprisingly individual. What
seems reasonable is the entire abolition of age limits in lending
libraries, subject to the reservation that the librarian should have
discretionary power to refuse to issue books to any child unable
to read and write. Failing this, the limit might be fixed at
twelve where there are no separate juvenile libraries, but reduced
to seven where such departments exist. There is a certain amount
of trouble and inconvenience to adults resulting from admitting
very young children, especially in open access and other libraries
without separate juvenile accommodation, and this would be
partly met by the compromise proposed. Separate children&#8217;s
libraries are the solution of the difficulty, and, when these can be
provided all round, the age limit downwards can be abolished so
far as they are concerned, while the limit for the adult library
can be raised to twelve or fourteen. But adequate provision
should be made for interchanging, and all necessary facilities
provided for enabling intelligent young people under the limit
to procure suitable more advanced books if desired, and also for
allowing adults to revive their youth by allowing them access to
the works of Ballantyne, Henty and other authors.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec351">351.</h4>

<p><b>351.</b> As regards age limits in reference libraries and reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
rooms, there is more to be said for keeping them high than in
the case of lending libraries, especially when there are separate
children&#8217;s rooms. But, generally speaking, there is no strong
reason for excluding well-conducted boys or girls from a popular
reading room, whatever their ages may be, provided they do not
come during school hours, or do not otherwise make the library
a place in which to hide from some duty. In some libraries,
with age limits of twelve, fourteen or over, it is the practice to
turn away younger children from news and reading rooms in
cases where they are accompanied by their parents or elders.
This is an abuse of a rule which was only intended to protect
readers from the noisy incursions of irresponsible youngsters, who
are wont to stray into public places out of sheer devilment, or
accident, or excess of curiosity. To apply this rule to children
in arms, or youngsters accompanied by and in charge of their
elders, is simply officialism calculated to injure the popularity
and prestige of municipal libraries. The age limit for a reference
library designed for students, with open access to the shelves,
should be fixed at fourteen or sixteen, with discretionary power
to the librarian to grant permits to any studious youngster
under that age. Where access to public reading rooms and
juvenile departments is easy, there seems no good reason for
throwing open the reference library to all and sundry, unless
under the safeguards suggested.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec352">352. The Borrowing Right.</h4>

<p><b>352. The Borrowing Right.</b>&mdash;There are several points in connexion
with the borrowing rights of various classes of citizens
which it is desirable to notice, especially as they have much
bearing on the question of a library&#8217;s popularity and good management.
In some towns the borrowing right is strictly confined
to ratepayers or residents in the library district. Employees
who live outside the district are excluded, but for what particular
reason it is difficult to understand. An employee contributes
directly to the material well-being of the district in which
his work lies; he contributes indirectly but substantially
towards the rates; he spends most of his waking and all his
working hours in the district; and in other ways he is as much
a citizen as the resident who works outside the district and only
sleeps in it at night. It is impossible to discover any reason for
the distinction made between employee and resident in some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
places, and it may be pointed out that plenty of large towns
grant the borrowing right to employees without the slightest
inconvenience, difficulty or injustice to anyone. A further wise
liberality permits borrowing privileges to all non-resident scholars
and students at schools or similar institutions in the town.
Similar arguments apply in favour of such an arrangement,
and these young folks are usually readers of a valuable type.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec353">353.</h4>

<p><b>353.</b> Teachers and others engaged in educational work should
be dealt with as generously as possible, and should be lent as
many books as they need at a time for purposes of their work.
From six to twelve works are frequently required by a teacher
in preparing a subject, and he should be allowed to have them,
the most liberal interpretation possible being given to this
privilege. Obviously no teacher should be permitted to make
his needs an excuse for borrowing batches of current and popular
works to the detriment of other readers, but it is better to risk
even this than to fail him in what may be an important matter.
A teacher reaches farther than the average individual.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec354">354.</h4>

<p><b>354.</b> Another regulation which tells against the interests of
municipal libraries is that in which every intending borrower,
ratepayer or otherwise, is required to obtain the signatures of
one or two registered ratepayers as guarantors before a ticket
will be issued. It is not necessary to imagine reasons for this
very serious obstacle to intending borrowers. Since many large
and small towns dispense with this precaution in the case of
ratepayers, and allow non-ratepayers and compounding householders
to have tickets on the guarantee or recommendation of
one ratepayer or on leaving a small deposit, there is no reason
why this elaborate double guarantee should not be abolished all
round. The time will doubtless come when guarantees of all kinds
will be abolished and suitable recommendations substituted.</p>

<p>There are other antiquated and needless restrictions in connexion
with the borrowing right which need not be specified at
length, but are grouped together here as examples of bad rules
for which there is little justification.</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80 blankbefore" id="Ref40"><span class="padl1">1.</span>
The illegal charge of 1d. or 2d. for tickets or voucher forms, still levied
in some places in defiance of the Public Libraries Act, 1892, Section
11, Sub-section (3); and various judicial decisions.</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80"><span class="padl1">2.</span> Requiring more than three days&#8217; notice before issuing a
borrowe<span class="pagenumlg"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>r&#8217;s
ticket. (In some places borrowers are required to wait for a week
or fourteen days from the date of lodging their application for tickets.)</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80" id="Ref45"><span class="padl1">3.</span> Limiting the time for reading books to less than fourteen days.</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80"><span class="padl1">4.</span> Refusing to renew books by post-card, letter, telephone, or messenger,
and requiring that the actual books shall be brought back to be
re-dated.</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80" id="Ref31a"><span class="padl1">5.</span> The imposition of fines amounting to more than 1d. per week or part
of a week for overdue books. (In certain libraries, some of which
are not pressed for funds, the exorbitant fine of 1d. per day is imposed
for overdue books, with a time limit of seven, ten and fourteen days.
This question is further considered in <a href="#Sec355">Section 355</a>.)</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80"><span class="padl1">6.</span> Refusing to exchange books on the same day as that on which they
are issued. (As the books which are brought back for exchange are
usually those which the borrowers have read previously, there seems
little need for such a disobliging rule.)</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80"><span class="padl1">7.</span> Refusing to issue books on the same day as that on which they are
returned to the library. (A common practice in the old-fashioned
libraries, worked by means of charging ledgers, but still found in
several much more up-to-date libraries. The same craze for tantalizing
the public has in a minor degree infected some open access lending
libraries which will not re-issue returned books until they have been
replaced on their shelves by the assistants.)</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80"><span class="padl1">8.</span> Charging borrowers 1d. or 2d. as a penalty for losing their tickets and
requiring them to be re-issued. (Query, a contravention of the Act.)</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80"><span class="padl1">9.</span> Disallowing the use of ink for copying purposes in all circumstances.</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80">10. Allowing only one volume at a time to borrowers.</p>

<p class="hind0_15 fsize80">11. Restricting the number of books which a reference reader may have at
one time.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec355">355. Fines and Penalties.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>355. Fines and Penalties.</b>&mdash;So long as the present rate limitation
remains as fixed by successive Acts of Parliament, fines will
continue to be levied in British municipal libraries. There is no
doubt that the small incomes realized in most public libraries
from the niggardly provision made by Parliament is one cause
of the efforts made in many cases to increase funds, by imposing
fines of varying degrees of severity upon the borrowers from
lending libraries. This is, indeed, the principal reason, though
it is said that, but for penalties of some sort, books would never
be returned at all. There may be some truth in this, as regards
a small proportion of borrowers, but the experience of Manchester
and some American towns where no fines are imposed rather
modifies the statement as to the supposed disastrous effects of
non-fining. This, like many another question, is one on which
the inexperienced theoretical objector appeals to his imagination
for details of all sorts of hardships, inconveniences and dangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
arising as the result of abolishing fines. Every argument is
directed towards showing how the library would suffer, and
incidentally it has been mentioned that, perhaps, the undue
retention of a popular book would prove highly inconvenient to
other readers who wanted it. These matters need not be discussed,
since it must be obvious that popular books can always
be duplicated to a certain extent; that more diligence can be
exercised in the tracing, pursuit and ingathering of overdue
popular books; and that there are methods of punishing hardened
delinquent borrowers of this kind, by suspending their
tickets, as is done at Manchester without serious results. But
it is quite evident that in Britain fining for overdue books will
be maintained until it is declared illegal&mdash;and no doubt, with
bye-laws not legally confirmed, it is a doubtful practice, in
England at all events&mdash;or Parliament has removed the rate
limitation or provided other means of financial assistance, without
all this scraping, pinching and doubtful means of increasing
funds. What is suggested is more latitude in the imposition of
fines, and a less eager desire to make money over the business
than is implied in such fines as 1d. a day, and fines of two, three,
four and five cents as charged in some American libraries. No
library has a right or any need to make a profit out of such a
transaction as fining for overdue books, and it would be better
to make a uniform charge of 1d. per week, or portion of a week,
for books retained over a fortnight, when not renewed by postcard
or otherwise.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec356">356. Holiday and Sunday Opening.</h4>

<p><b>356. Holiday and Sunday Opening.</b>&mdash;Whether libraries are to
be opened or not on public holidays and Sundays is largely a
matter for local option. In some places libraries have been
experimentally opened on <span class="smcapall">PUBLIC HOLIDAYS</span> on the sentimental
plea that many persons are unable to use them at any other
time, and the result has been anything but encouraging. In
other places, like seaside and holiday resorts, they have been
opened on such holidays, with decided advantage to trippers
seeking shelter from inclement weather. Generally speaking,
all libraries should be <i>closed</i> on public holidays, on the grounds
that a general holiday should be generally observed as such,
and that people are much better in the fresh air than sitting
indoors in libraries or anywhere else on such occasions. If any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
exception to this were made it would be to open only on wet and
stormy public holidays, but always except Christmas, and, in
the case of Scotland, New Year&#8217;s Day. The public holidays in
Britain are too few and far between to effect any radical influence
upon libraries or readers.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec357">357.</h4>

<p><b>357.</b> As regards <span class="smcap">Sundays</span>, conditions are rather different.
To begin with there are more of them, and they come at regular
intervals. But unless the need for Sunday opening can be
demonstrated by a satisfactory result derived from a series of
trial openings, it is better for the libraries not to be opened as a
mere concession to the views of certain societies, or the supposed
utility of the movement to people who are alleged to be unable
to come on week-days. If experiment proves that Sunday
opening is meeting a real need, open the libraries by all means,
but not otherwise. As a compromise it is suggested that if
Sunday opening is decided upon, the reading rooms only should
be open between the hours of 3 and 9 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> on every Sunday
between October and May inclusive. There is little need for
Sunday opening in warm weather&mdash;people are much better out-of-doors&mdash;especially
if, as is usually the case, attendances fall off
greatly.</p>

<p>Should the Sunday opening question become a burning one
in any town, arrangements might be made to open the reading
room and reference library, provided at least 500 citizens take
out tickets as an earnest of their intention to use the library.
It is doubtful if in any town Sunday opening has been limited
to students and other inquirers, but it would form a reasonable
manner of settling a difficult question should opinion be sharply
divided.</p>

<p>As regards ways and means of carrying on the business of a
public library on holidays and Sundays, special arrangements
must be made, both as regards the necessary attendants, heating,
lighting and cleaning.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec358">358. Enforcement of Rules.</h4>

<p><b>358. Enforcement of Rules.</b>&mdash;There is nothing in the original
English or Irish Acts which gives power to enforce rules and
bye-laws, but in the Act of 1901 such may be obtained provided
the rules are approved by the Local Government Board. In the
Scotch Act very full provisions are made for the confirmation
and enforcement of bye-laws. Clause 22 of the Act of 1887<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
reads: &#8220;It shall be lawful for the committee to make bye-laws
for regulating all or any matters and things whatsoever connected
with the control, management, protection and use of any property,
articles or things under their control for the purposes of
this Act, and to impose such penalties for breaches of such bye-laws,
not exceeding &pound;5 for each offence, as may be considered
expedient; and from time to time, as they shall think fit, to
repeal, alter, vary or re-enact any such bye-laws, provided
always that such bye-laws and alterations thereof shall not be
repugnant to the law of Scotland, and before being acted on
shall be signed by a quorum of the committee, and, except in
so far as they relate solely to the officers or servants of the committee,
such bye-laws shall be approved of by the magistrates
and council, or the board, as the case may be, and shall be
approved of and confirmed by the sheriff of the county in which
the burgh or parish, or the greater part of the area thereof, is
situated.&#8221; Provision is also made for advertising and giving due
notice of intention to adopt the bye-laws.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec359">359.</h4>

<p><b>359.</b> It should be stated, however, that there are quite a
number of cases in which magistrates&#8217; decisions in England
have upheld the rules of Public Library Committees with regard
to recovery of fines for overdue books, the value of books lost
and guaranteed, and on other points. In some of these cases it
has not been held or suggested that guarantee or voucher forms
should be stamped as agreements, or that any limit under &pound;5
should be placed on the amount of the guarantor&#8217;s liability.
Nevertheless, a value limit of &pound;1 or &pound;2 might be placed upon a
guarantor&#8217;s liability, and that will dispose of the awkward point
as to the agreement being stamped.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec360">360. Draft Rules and Regulations.</h4>

<p><b>360. Draft Rules and Regulations.</b>&mdash;These draft rules are
based upon a careful examination of the principal bye-laws
adopted by many of the principal libraries in Britain and the
United States, with certain modifications to harmonize them
with certain leading principles advocated throughout this book.
No two places are exactly alike in all their circumstances and
local conditions, so that no library is likely to adopt these rules
exactly as they stand. But they contain suggestions which may
be found useful in drawing up and adopting a series of suitable
rules, and enabling most vital points to be met. Some libraries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
have an enormous number of rules, amounting in some cases to
fifty or sixty items, but many of these are quite unnecessary
and need not be considered. The draft rules drawn up by the
Local Government Board may be obtained if thought needful;
but they are printed separately in the <i>Library Association
Record</i>, 1903, p. 28. The fewer and simpler the rules the more
likely are the people to read and observe them.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80"><span class="padl1">8.</span> Every person on entering the reference library shall sign his or her
name, with the correct address, in a book kept for the purpose. Anyone
giving a false name or address shall be liable to prosecution, and

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80"><span class="padl1">9.</span> Every person before leaving the room shall return the book or books
consulted into the hands of the librarian or his assistants, and must
not replace books taken from the open shelves, but leave them with
the assistant at the exit.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">10. Any work in the lending department, if not in use, excepting Fiction,
may be had on application at the reference library counter for
perusal in the reading room, but on no account must such books be
taken from the room.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref42">11. Illustrations of all kinds may be copied, but not traced, save by permission
of the librarian. Extracts from books may be copied in
pencil. The use of ink is only permitted at certain tables which are
reserved for the purpose. Certain works are only issued after a
written application to the library committee.</p>

<p class="center fsize80 blankbefore"><span class="smcap">Lending Department</span></p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80 blankbefore" id="Ref34">12. The lending library is open daily for the issue and receipt of books
every week-day from 10 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> till 9 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, but shall be closed on Sundays,
Christmas Day (New Year&#8217;s Day), all public holidays and such other
days as the committee may from time to time appoint.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref04">13. Books shall be borrowed for home reading only by persons rated,
resident or employed in the Borough of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;., or qualified
by <a href="#Ref02">Rule 18</a>.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref03">14. All persons whose names appear on the current Roll of Electors of the
Borough, or in the local directories as residents, may borrow books
on their own responsibility, after filling up an application for a
borrower&#8217;s ticket, on a form provided for the purpose.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref09">15. Other residents, and non-resident employees in the borough, over
twelve (fourteen) years of age, may borrow books, but must first
obtain a guarantee (or recommendation) from a duly qualified person,
as defined in <a href="#Ref03">Rule 14</a>, and must sign an application for a borrower&#8217;s
ticket, on forms to be provided by the librarian. But no such
guarantor shall be allowed to assume responsibility for more than
three other persons, unless by special arrangement with the committee,
and in no single case shall his or her liability exceed &pound;2 per
person guaranteed.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref05">16. Any person resident or employed in the borough, unable to obtain the
signature of a qualified resident as a guarantee, may borrow books
on<span class="pagenumlg"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
leaving a deposit of 10s. with the librarian. The guarantee of the
recognized head officials of Government departments, Friendly
Societies and similar organizations may be accepted at the discretion
of the Committee in lieu of an ordinary guarantee, for persons
who are employed in the district.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">17. The Application and Guarantee Form, duly signed, must be delivered
to the librarian, and if, on examination, it is found correct, the
borrower&#8217;s ticket will be issued three days (<i>or</i> at once) after (excluding
Sundays), but will only be delivered to the borrower in person. This
ticket will be available at the central library or any branch or
branches.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref02">18. In accordance with Section 11 of the Public Libraries Act, 1892, the
committee will lend books to persons, other than those duly qualified
under <a href="#Ref04">Rules 13</a>-<a href="#Ref05">16</a>, who pay an annual subscription of 7s. 6d.; but
such borrowers must conform, in every respect, to all the rules of the
library, and shall have no privileges other than those possessed by
the other borrowers.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref13">19. The committee shall issue additional tickets to readers, available for
all classes of literature save Fiction. Any duly enrolled borrower may
have one of these extra tickets on filling up an application form as
for an ordinary ticket. School teachers may have more than one
ticket of this class on application to the librarian.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref06">20. All tickets and vouchers must be renewed annually, each ticket and
voucher being reckoned available for one year from date of issue.<a name="FNanchor_13"

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a>
In some libraries the practice has arisen of making tickets permanent, as
long as the holder resides in the district, without renewal annually. In place
of renewal, a revision takes place, to ensure accuracy of addresses, etc.;
where this is so, <a href="#Ref06">Rule 20</a> is unnecessary.</p></div>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref10">21. The borrower must return each volume lent within fifteen days, including
days of issue and return, and shall be liable to a fine of 1d.
per week or portion of a week for each volume lent, if not returned
within that period, but the issue of a book may be renewed for a
further period of fifteen days, dating from the day of intimation,
on notice being given to the librarian either personally or in writing,
and no further renewal will be allowed if the book is required by
another reader. Books which are much in demand may, however,
be refused such renewal at the discretion of the librarian.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">22. Each volume on return shall be delivered to the librarian or his
assistant, and if on examination it be found to have sustained any
damage or injury, the person to whom it was lent, or his or her
guarantor, shall be required to pay the amount of damage done or
to procure a new copy or series of equal value, and, in the latter case,
the person supplying the new copy shall be entitled to the damaged
copy or series on depositing the new one.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref11">23. Borrowers who are unable to obtain a particular non-fictional book,
and desire that it shall be retained for them on its return, must give
its title, number, etc., to the assistant, and pay 1d. to cover cost
of posting an intimation that it is available for issue; but no
book<span class="pagenumlg"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
will be kept longer than the time mentioned in the notice sent.
Novels cannot be reserved under this rule.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">24. Borrowers are required to keep the books clean. They are not to turn
down or stain the leaves, nor to make pencil or other marks upon
them. They must take the earliest opportunity of reporting any
damage or injury done to the books they receive, otherwise they
will be held responsible for the value of the same.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref12">25. If an infectious disease breaks out in any house containing books
belonging to the library, such books are not to be returned to the
library, but must be handed over to the Medical Officer of Health or
any sanitary officer acting on his behalf. Until such infected house
is declared free of disease by the Medical Officer of Health, no books
will be issued from the libraries to any person or persons residing
therein. In similar circumstances non-resident ratepayers or employees
must return their books to the Medical Officer, and cease to
use the libraries till their residences are certified free from infection.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">26. Only actual borrowers who are enrolled on the register of the library
shall have the right of direct access to the book-shelves, but their
representatives may be admitted at the discretion of the librarian or
his assistants. To prevent disappointment, these representatives
should come provided with a list of several book-titles and numbers.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">27. Any change in the residence of borrowers or their guarantors, or notice
of withdrawal of guarantee, must be intimated to the librarian within
one week.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">28. Borrowers leaving the district or ceasing to use the library are required
to return their tickets to the librarian in order to have them cancelled;
otherwise they and their guarantors will be held responsible
for any books taken out in their names.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">29. No person under twelve years of age shall be eligible to borrow books
or make use of the adult library, except by the librarian&#8217;s permission.</p>

<p class="center fsize80 blankbefore"><span class="smcap">General Reading and Magazine Rooms</span></p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80 blankbefore" id="Ref37">30. The general reading room shall remain open on
week-days from 8 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span>
till 10 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>, and the magazine room from 9
<span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> till 10 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span> (and on
Sundays, from October to May inclusive, from 3 to 9 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>). Both
rooms shall be closed on Christmas Day (New Year&#8217;s Day), all public
holidays, and such other days as the committee may from time to
time appoint.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">31. No persons under twelve years of age, unless accompanied by their
parents or elders capable of controlling them, shall be allowed to use
these rooms, except by permission of the librarian or his assistants.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">32. Any persons who use these rooms for purposes of betting, or who in
any way cause obstruction or disorder in these or any other rooms or
passages of the libraries, are liable to be proceeded against under the
provisions of 61 &amp; 62 <i>Vict., c. 53, An Act to Provide for the Punishment
of Offences in Libraries</i>, 1898.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80" id="Ref38a">33. Readers in possession of newspapers or other periodicals must be prepared
to resign them to any other reader who may ask to peruse<span class="pagenumlg"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
them, ten minutes after the request has been made through one of
the library staff.</p>

<p class="center fsize80 blankbefore"><span class="smcap">Juvenile Room</span></p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80 blankbefore">34. The juvenile reading room and library shall remain open from 4 till 8

10 <span class="smcapall">A.M.</span> till 6 <span class="smcapall">P.M.</span>
on Saturdays.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">35. The admission is free to every boy or girl under (twelve) fourteen
years of age residing in the Borough of

able to write and read; but they must obtain a guarantee (or recommendation)
from their parents or school teacher as to good behaviour
and safe return of all books.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">36. Only one book per week will be allowed to each borrower.</p>

<p class="hind0_3 fsize80">37. Application for tickets admitting to the reading room must be made
at the library.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">There are certain admonitory rules which are best displayed
in frames in placard form, such as: SILENCE IS REQUESTED;
NO CONVERSATION ALLOWED; NO DOGS ADMITTED;
CYCLISTS ARE REQUESTED TO KEEP THEIR MACHINES
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING; PLEASE WIPE YOUR BOOTS;
NO ADMISSION THIS WAY; NO SMOKING ALLOWED;
and so on. Some of the general rules would be much more

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec361">361. Notes on Rules.</h4>

<p><b>361. Notes on Rules.</b>&mdash;<a href="#Ref07">1</a> and <a href="#Ref08">2</a>. These rules are included for
the purpose of qualifying for the certificate of exemption from
income-tax and local rates, as described in <a href="#Sec37">Sections 37</a>-<a href="#Sec40">40</a>.</p>

<p><a href="#Ref09">15</a>. In some libraries the guarantee of responsible heads of
large government and other departments is accepted for all the
employees, and secretaries of associations and school teachers
have also been accepted. In the first case the association has
become responsible for all its eligible members, and signs through
its secretary. In the second case the teacher assumes responsibility
for all his eligible pupils. It should be understood that a
teacher&#8217;s guarantee does not involve the teacher in financial
responsibility, but is an indication of his opinion that the applicant
may benefit by the use of the library, and usually includes
the assumption that he will use his moral influence to secure the
due care and return of books. Some libraries have abolished
the guarantee for non-ratepayers.</p>

<p id="Ref28"><a href="#Ref05">16</a>. <span class="smcap">Depositors</span> should be treated as ordinary borrowers,
and their tickets and numbering should go through the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
routine. The money received from deposits may either be paid
into the bank and repaid as wanted by depositors from petty
cash, or held by the librarian and repaid when called up. Deposit
money of this kind when paid into the bank tends somewhat to
complicate and falsify the accounts by recording receipts which
do not belong to the library, and inflating the petty cash
expenditures, but borough accountants regard it as orthodox
book-keeping as a rule. The practice differs in all places as
regards this point, and the librarian may keep a separate
account of these moneys, whether paid into the bank or not.</p>

<p id="Ref43"><a href="#Ref02">18</a>. Under the powers conferred by the 1892 Act, many public
libraries now permit persons residing outside the district who
are not otherwise qualified to become borrowers on payment of
an annual subscription, ranging from 5s. to 10s. The money
received from this source should be paid into the subscriptions
account at the bank, and a proper receipt given to the subscriber,
showing how long the subscription is current.</p>

<p id="Ref14"><a href="#Ref10">21</a>. The <span class="smcapall">RENEWAL OF BOOKS</span> is generally allowed without
question, if no inquiries for them in the interval have been
recorded. In other cases, such renewals must, of course, be
refused, unless the books are not returned, in which case nothing
can be done. Here again the eternal fiction question arises,
and there are reasonable doubts if the right of renewal should
be allowed in the case of recent popular novels. With classic
fiction and other books it is quite another matter, and students
should be allowed to renew within all reasonable limits, and by
any reasonable means&mdash;post-card, telephone, message or other&mdash;providing
that readers give the necessary particulars. A form
of renewal slip is used at some libraries which may be useful.
Copies are taken away by any borrower who thinks he may
require them, and if he desires to renew a book, he simply fills
up a slip and sends it by hand or post to the library. The
assistant then picks out the charge from the charging system,
inserts the renewal slip in the pocket, and re-issues it under the
current date. The renewals may be picked out and sorted in
one sequence behind a special guide, so that when a book is
returned which has not been re-dated, it is easy to find it; or a
&#8220;dummy&#8221; book card may be inserted in order under the original
date of issue bearing a reference to the date of renewal&mdash;this
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
perhaps the more effective method. Renewals should count as
re-issues, and a record should be made of the issue of all books
which are thus renewed.</p>

<p class="blankbefore" id="Ref20"><a href="#Ref11">23</a>. The practice of <span class="smcapall">RESERVING
BOOKS</span> has been adopted in
many libraries, and within certain limits it is useful. The chief
points connected with the matter are whether all books should
be reserved, and how many orders for the same popular book
should be booked at once. As regards the first point, it is wise
to exclude current popular, but not classic, fiction from the
operation of the rule, partly for the reason that in this class
duplicates of popular novels are generally stocked, and also
because it is necessary to restrict as much as possible any privilege
which may seem to favour one class to the exclusion of
another, as there is no doubt that the charge of 1d. will
practically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
exclude many poor people from participating in this method
of book-reservation. It is simple to make a rough distinction
between classic and current fiction, by adding the classic symbol
(some arbitrary sign) to the class-mark of all books which have
been published more than ten years. Such works are not necessarily
classic, of course, but all that is contemplated is to prevent
the holding-up on reservation lists of the latest works. As
regards the second point, librarians will have to exercise a nice
discretion as to how many readers they will place on the rota
at one time, as it is quite conceivable that to reserve any popular
work twenty or thirty times ahead is simply to cut it off from
general circulation for an indefinite period. In the case of very
popular books, the possibility of buying a special copy for reservation
should be contemplated. As regards the method of
working the system of reserving books, the usual plan is to sell
a post-card to the borrower, who addresses it to himself and
enters the name of the book wanted. These post-cards are then
returned to the librarian, who arranges them in order, and, as
the books are stopped on return, sends out the post-card next
in order. A usual form for the post-card is as follows: &#8220;Please
note that the book
.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
reserved by you,
has now been returned, and will be kept for you till the evening
of .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221; The assistant fills in the date
by which the book should be claimed. Of course, borrowers
who fail to claim miss their turn. A separate register of these
reserved books can be kept in addition to the cards, if thought
advisable. A receipt should, of course, be given for each post-card,
and in some libraries the numbers of the books reserved
are written on the counterfoils.</p>

<p id="Ref29"><a href="#Ref12">25</a>. <span class="smcap">Infectious Diseases Notification.</span>&mdash;Authorities differ
greatly as to the power of books to carry and disseminate disease.
American and English bacteriologists, after exhaustive researches
and tests, declare that dirty books cannot convey infection, whilst
German and French scientists are not so sure. The latest tests
and theories are negative. Infection is conveyed in a wet state
from the patient to another person, and it is affirmed that when
contagious matter has dried it is innocuous. It is, therefore, clear
that the conditions under which books may carry disease rarely,
if ever, occur. As library assistants are continually turning over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
handling and inhaling the dust, etc., from lending library books
without observed ill results, it may be assumed that the danger of
infection, if it exists at all, is greatly exaggerated. But as the
public mind is somewhat excited over this question, it is necessary
for library authorities to take steps to reassure the people
that everything is done to prevent disease being communicated
through the medium of library books. The Public Health Acts
are quite clear on the point that persons suffering from infectious
diseases, or in charge of other persons so suffering, are liable to
penalties for lending any article; and this would cover the case
of a library which re-issued a book which came from an infected
house. The practice should therefore be for the local sanitary
authority to seize all library books found on disease-infected
premises, and simply destroy them after due notification to the
library authority. A further notification should be sent to the
library when the house has been disinfected and declared free
from disease, as in the meantime the librarian has stopped the
issue of books to persons in the disease-stricken house from the
date of the first intimation. There are various forms of notice
used for notifying when and where disease breaks out, and what
books are destroyed, and also for declaring the infected house
free from disease. As regards the disinfection of books by
means of fumes, etc., the opinion is that it cannot be properly
done without destroying the bindings, and it is best to take the
extreme course in view of the public fears. As regards the cost
of replacing such destroyed books, the local sanitary authority
can be called upon to do this under the provisions of the Public
Health Acts, 1901, but unless the annual loss is very great, it
seems hardly advisable to raise the point. In small places or
towns with very limited book funds, the sanitary authority
should certainly be asked to replace all books which are destroyed.
It is a wise plan to keep a separate record of books which are
destroyed in the interest of the public health. This need not
note any further particulars than the dates, titles and numbers
of books, and cost. A column can be reserved for remarks.</p>

<h2>DIVISION XI<br />
THE LENDING, OR HOME READING,
DEPARTMENT</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XXIV<br />
<span class="title">THE REGISTRATION OF BORROWERS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec366">366. General.</h4>

<p><b>366. General.</b>&mdash;By a tradition now firmly implanted in the
mind of the public, and nourished by journalists, the lending
department is the most prominent feature of the public library.
The average public criticism, favourable or otherwise, is almost
invariably based upon lending library statistics. This is probably
because the average person knows the library as a place from
which he may &#8220;take out&#8221; books. In a treatise for librarians
the inadequacy of this view need not be stressed, although,
as in many matters connected with their calling, librarians are
not unanimous as to the relative value of their departments,
some exalting one or other at the expense of the rest. There
are, however, clear principles which have a fairly general acceptation.
The main one is that in libraries which are in fairly close
proximity to much greater libraries, it is wise to place more
emphasis on the lending than on the reference department. It
would be an unjustifiable duplicating of expense for a library,
for example, within a mile or two of the British Museum, to
attempt the hopeless task of rivalling it in the provision of
expensive reference works; while on the other hand it would
be justified abundantly in providing the finest possible lending
library. Even here dogmatism is to be avoided, because the
habits of populations in what appear to be exactly similar localities
may differ greatly. Where, for example, a city working
population living in a large suburb returns rarely or not at all
to the city in the evenings, there may be a real demand for a
reference library. Only experience, which bears in mind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
general principles stated, can resolve which policy it is best to
follow.</p>

<p>On account of its prominence and the numerous opportunities
for good work it affords, the lending library deserves the utmost
care in its planning and administration, and the simplest and
freest methods compatible with reasonable care for the safety of
the books are the best. All the considerations we have described
as to book-selection and weeding-out, etc., apply with particular
force in this department; and a careful study should be made
of the various methods of issue described in the next chapter
before one is chosen, as a wrong choice may inflict much hardship
on readers and later involve changes which will be most
expensive; in fact, the converting of a lending library from
one system to another is probably the most costly operation in
which it can be involved. The staffing of the department
requires just as much consideration as that of any other, and
the all too frequent and often unavoidable practice of employing
the youngest boys and girls at the charging counters or desks is
much to be deprecated even when it cannot be altogether avoided.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec367">367. Voucher Forms.</h4>

<p><b>367. Voucher Forms.</b>&mdash;There are all kinds of voucher forms
in use in the municipal libraries of the United Kingdom, ranging
in size from foolscap folio to post-card. These vouchers are the
forms on which borrowers apply for tickets entitling them to use
the library, and they are the basis of the necessary registration
of borrowers which all libraries must perform. It is not needful
to describe more than one form, because it is gradually being
adopted, with variations to suit different localities, as the
standard system of the country. The legal questions connected
with the validity of certain forms of guarantee are also beyond
the scope of this section, because judicial rulings have been
obtained on all kinds of forms, and the only point requiring consideration,
that of the amount of the guarantor&#8217;s liability, has
already been discussed.</p>

<p>A form of voucher which can be used as a movable card
(5 in. by 3 in.) is preferable to a large slip, which requires binding
in volumes, or other special means of preservation; and the
style of cards given in <a href="#Fig133">Figs. 133</a>-<a href="#Fig136">136</a> will be found satisfactory.</p>

<p>These voucher cards should be printed on a stout material,
which may be of a different colour for each type of reader&mdash;burgess,<span
class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
non-burgess, student, etc.&mdash;and handed free to any
person entitled to borrow books. When returned filled up, they
are duly examined to ascertain if the applicant is duly qualified,
and when this is done the card is filed, after it has been numbered
from the number book, and the borrower&#8217;s card made out.
The space in the top left-hand corner is to hold the borrower&#8217;s
name, boldly written in as a catch-word for alphabetical arrangement.
The No.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. space at the top right-hand corner is for the
borrower&#8217;s progressive number. The Date.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. space at the bottom
left-hand corner is the date of application, which also becomes
the date of expiry two years later. The Elector&#8217;s Roll.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. space
at the bottom right-hand corner is for the number on the current
electors&#8217; roll. It is a useful thing to mark this roll with the
numbers of the cards of any borrowers for whom a ratepayer
may be guarantor, in all cases where a limit is put to the number
whom one person may guarantee. There is generally plenty of
marginal space for this purpose.</p>

(<a href="#Sec368">Section 368</a>).</p>

<p class="blankbefore">In some libraries the guarantee form has been entirely abandoned
in favour of a recommendation which carries with it no
explicit liability for losses.</p>

<p>The vouchers for non-ratepayer applicants should be dealt
with in the same way as those for ratepayers, viz., checked with
registers and filed in the alphabetical order of surnames, after
tickets have been made out and an entry made in the number
book.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec369">369.</h4>

<p><b>369.</b> It will be seen that the vouchers illustrated permit any
borrower who desires it to acquire a non-fiction or duplicate ticket
in addition to a general ticket. The more general practice has
been to require a separate voucher to be filled up (and guaranteed
in the case of non-burgesses) for every such ticket. In this case
the voucher requires no separate wording, but the word &#8220;Duplicate&#8221;
or &#8220;Non-Fiction&#8221; stamped boldly across the ordinary
voucher is sufficient to indicate the difference. But there seems
no special advantage in making the applicant go through this
double process. The same holds good with regard to vouchers
for those who make a deposit in lieu of obtaining a written
guarantee, or who subscribe in terms of <a href="#Ref02">Rule 18</a>. The words
<span class="smcapall">DEPOSITOR OF</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.
or <span class="smcapall">SUBSCRIBER OF</span> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and the date can be
written or stamped on the back of the card. Of course there is
no reason, beyond avoiding a multiplicity of cards, why a library
should not provide separate forms for every class of applicant,
with differently coloured cards, etc., but it seems unnecessary,
unless there are special local circumstances to be considered.</p>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>370. Tickets.</b>&mdash;Various forms of borrowers&#8217; tickets are used
with indicators and card charging, but only the kinds most
commonly used need be described. One form is shown below
(<a href="#Fig137">Fig. 137</a>) for libraries in which borrowers retain their tickets
when they have no books on loan. They are made with cloth
backs to fold across, and the one with the clipped corner is a
good form to adopt for students&#8217; or extra tickets available for
non-fictional works only. The variety shown is not ruled to
hold a record of the numbers of books which are borrowed upon
it, as it does not seem necessary to keep such a record. To keep
it involves a great deal of work, and the information it affords,
being practically confined to what type of book an individual
reads, is rarely wanted. As a check on lost books it may have
some value, but that has no relation to the cost of keeping it.</p>

is therefore noted here and not with other cards among the

<span class="smcapall">DUPLICATE</span> or <span class="smcapall">STUDENTS&#8217;</span> tickets available for non-fiction works
only, in addition to an ordinary ticket available for all classes of
literature, first became popular in Britain in 1893, and arose out
of a suggestion made by Mr J. Y. W. MacAlister at the Library
Association Conference at Aberdeen. In America this is generally
known as the &#8220;Two-Book System,&#8221; and it became very
widely adopted after 1894. Indeed, American libraries are most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
generous in their lending; many libraries lend as many as ten
books at a time; and one or two have recently (1919) invited
borrowers to take at any one time &#8220;as many as they like.&#8221;
The advantage of this indiscriminate freedom is not quite obvious,
and, owing to their more limited stocks, it would be impossible
in most British libraries. There are decided advantages in the
plan of allowing borrowers to have two books at a time, and
there is no doubt it greatly enhances the value of the public
library to many people. As indicated by <a href="#Ref13">Rule 19</a>, <a href="#Sec360">Section 360</a>,
special privileges are recommended to be extended to school
teachers, who ought to be allowed any number of books, within
reason, required for their special and important work of education.
There is no objection to allowing special privileges to all
earnest students engaged on special lines of research, provided
no injustice is done to the general work of the library or to
students similarly engaged. Certainly it is better to lend a real<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
student half a dozen or more books at a time than to have these
books lying idle at the library. Of course, in libraries with more
readers than books, if there are any, extra tickets will require
to be issued with caution, but in all large libraries the privilege
can be extended without fear or hesitation.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec372">372. Registration.</h4>

<p><b>372. Registration.</b>&mdash;All borrowers&#8217; tickets should be numbered
in a progressive series, and the same number should be given
to the same borrower as long as he or she remains connected
with the library. This prevents overlapping and the clumsy
method of numbering continuously up to a certain limit and
counting off the early numbers; a doubtful way of ascertaining
the total number of actual borrowers at any given time. The
ruling of a number register in book form is shown in <a href="#Fig138">Fig. 138</a>.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">In this each borrower is entered as he joins, receiving the first
vacant number, which is also carried on to his voucher and
ticket. The column is chosen which represents the year in which
his ticket expires, and against the number is written the borrower&#8217;s
name, and under it the month and day when the ticket
expires. The holder of a given ticket can be ascertained very
rapidly by this method, and time-expired or dead ticket-holders
can be counted off without trouble. But it is necessary to
mark or qualify the entries in order to do this. An easy way
to indicate an expired ticket is to mark the register with a blue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
tick (&#10003;) as shown in <a href="#Fig138">Fig. 138</a> (No. 2). These expired numbers
should be given to new borrowers, so as to keep the register
filled up and complete, and at the end of a given period, when
it is time to ascertain the number of &#8220;live&#8221; or actual ticket-holders,
it is only necessary to count the blue ticks, and deduct
their total from the last number of the series, in order to obtain
the exact number of current borrowers. A number register book
ruled as shown in <a href="#Fig138">Fig. 138</a> will last for many years. It is not
necessary to print the progressive numbers or years, and it will
facilitate counting operations if fifty numbers are allowed for
every page. Duplicate or special ticket-holders numbered in a
separate series should be entered in a special book, and juvenile
ticket-holders can be treated in a similar fashion.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec373">373.</h4>

<p><b>373.</b> To prevent the possibility of a number of tickets being
obtained by the same individuals, all tickets should be registered
and made out at one library of a town, but, of course, issued from
the library at which the application was made, and such tickets
should be made interchangeable. There does not seem to be
any advantage attached to separate branch registration, and
certainly there is much loss of good service when residents are
confined to the use of a particular branch. The residents in a
town are entitled to use any of the libraries, and a central registration
of borrowers is therefore essential.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec374">374.</h4>

<p><b>374.</b> When the borrowers&#8217; vouchers have been duly checked,
numbered, and the tickets have been written out, they should
be filed in alphabetical order of the borrowers&#8217; surnames in
properly guided trays (or, better, card cabinets), supplied with
all necessary angle blocks, etc., as in the case of charging and
card-catalogue trays and cabinets. These form the alphabetical
index to the borrowers, while the borrowers&#8217; number
register supplies the numerical side. Thus any question regarding
borrowers can be answered without delay. It is not
necessary to keep an alphabetical index of guarantors if
the electors&#8217; roll is marked as previously suggested.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXV<br />
<span class="title">ISSUE METHODS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec376">376.</h4>

<p><b>376.</b> In modern library practice, methods of book-registration
involving the use of ledgers or day-books have now been
entirely abandoned, save in a few proprietary and subscription
libraries. It will, therefore, be needless to describe charging
systems so generally discarded, and it will suffice if reference is
made to the first edition of this work, in which many forms were
illustrated and explained.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec377">377.</h4>

<p><b>377.</b> The great objection to all charging ledgers in book form
was their want of movability and adjustability. The entries
when once made were fixed, either in a running sequence under
a date of issue, a borrower&#8217;s name, or a book&#8217;s title. If, for any
purpose, it should be desirable to manipulate the entries, in
order to secure greater accuracy, or some definite record of a
special kind, the book ledgers did not lend themselves to this
sort of treatment. There was no kind of movability possible,
and questions which might be answered readily enough if entries
were movable and separate, could not be put to any issue record
in volume form. Chiefly because of this, the slip or card methods
of charging were introduced, which enable registration to be
conducted in a variety of ways for different purposes. It is
impossible to say when or where cards were first introduced,
but as they have been used for commercial purposes for years
before the public library system was established, it follows
that many minds must have discovered the utility and convenience
of movable entries. There are many varieties of card
or slip charging in existence, and innumerable methods of working
or applying them. Movable entry systems are in every
respect the most interesting, not only because they present
greater possibilities to the ingenious mind, but because they are
more scientific and more natural.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec378">378.</h4>

<p><b>378.</b> There have been numerous systems devised for
recording<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
issues of books from public libraries, but in none have so many
variations been introduced as in the great group using cards as
a basis. There is hardly any limit to be put to the variety of
ways in which cards can be used; and, without describing every
system in detail, it will nevertheless be interesting to select and
describe typical plans from among the more practical varieties,
as representative of each particular group. The fundamental
idea of all card systems of charging is that each book or volume
shall be represented by a movable card, which can be stored in
various ways when the book is on the shelf, and used to register
or charge the book, when issued, to its borrower.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec379">379.</h4>

<p><b>379.</b> When cards are used as movable entries, there is no
need to keep a column for showing date of return; and, before
describing a method of working, the following specimen ruling
for a card is given:</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 139.</span>&mdash;Book Issue-Card (<a href="#Sec379">Section 379</a>).</p>

<p class="blankbefore">The first and third columns may be used for the borrowers&#8217;
numbers, and the second and fourth for dates of issue, as shown
<a href="#Fig139">above</a>, or all four columns may be used for borrowers&#8217; numbers.
The backs of the cards may be ruled the same, without the
heading. These cards are kept in a strict numerical order of
progressive numbers in trays or drawers. When a book is
chosen by a borrower, the card representing it is withdrawn
from its place, the borrower&#8217;s number and date of issue entered,
the date of issue stamped on the date label of the book, and the
transaction is complete when the book-card is placed in a tray,
or behind a special block bearing the date of issue. At the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
of the day the cards are all sorted up in numerical order, as far
as possible, the statistics made up from them, and they are then
put away in the dated issue trays, or behind date blocks in
drawers. When a book is returned, its date and number direct
the assistant to the exact number of the book-card, which is
withdrawn, and at leisure replaced in the main sequence. No
other marking off is necessary, and the book is immediately
available for issue. Overdues gradually declare themselves, as
day after day passes, and the cards for books in circulation
diminish in number as returns are made. This is card charging
of a simple kind, which is rarely used nowadays, as in cases of
overdues, queries, etc., it necessitates reference to the borrowers&#8217;
register, and such references are always a nuisance; but it forms
the basis of all the more elaborate scientific systems.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec380">380.</h4>

<p><b>380.</b> The pocket system of card-charging is that most used
in the United Kingdom, not only as a separate method, but also
frequently in connexion with, or as an adjunct to, indicators.
This is a loose pocket system in which each book is represented
by a manila card (about 4 &times; 2 inches) ruled on both sides to take
borrowers&#8217; numbers and dates of issues. Every borrower is
represented by a card of a similar kind, but one inch shorter
(see <a href="#Fig140">Fig. 140</a>). When a book is issued its card is taken from the
tray, and, with the borrower&#8217;s card, is placed in a loose manila
pocket, the date of issue is stamped on the date label inside the
book and the borrower receives the volume. It is customary in
most open access libraries to hand the borrower his card when
his book is discharged. If he does not want another book at
the moment he retains his card for the future, but if he does
want another he selects one in the usual way, and hands it and
his ticket to the assistant at the exit charging wicket, where the
charge is made very rapidly by simply selecting the book-card
and &#8220;marrying&#8221; it with the borrower&#8217;s card in a loose pocket.
In some libraries the charges thus made are simply sorted by
book numbers and arranged behind projecting date guides in
the issue trays. In others this is postponed till the book numbers
have been carried on to the book-cards. Whatever method
of registration is adopted the ultimate result is that a complete
charge is got by mechanical means, which obviates the need for
writing at the moment of issue. The plan of keeping the book-cards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
in pockets inside the books has been adopted in some
libraries, but of course this destroys the value of the system as
an indicator to the staff of books in and out. At the same time,
in open access libraries particularly, it facilitates service at the
moment of issue. The conjoined cards of this loose pocket
system appear as in the diagrams on <a href="#Page_355">page 355</a> (<a href="#Fig142">Figs. 142</a>-<a href="#Fig143">3</a>).</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec381">381.</h4>

<p><b>381.</b> The following diagrams show one of the principal systems
of card charging now used in British libraries. Each book has
a small triangular pocket inside the front board, in which is
placed a small book-card (2 &times; 1<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>8</sub> inches) of manila, on which is
written the class number, author and title of the book it represents.
In cases of duplicate copies it is advisable to write the
accession number on the book-card to facilitate stocktaking.
Each book also has a date label inside the front board facing
the book pocket (<a href="#Fig141">Fig. 141</a>).</p>

the slot-fastening (<i>f</i>) of the guides (<i>e</i>). It has cut-away sides
to facilitate the handling of the cards; a back slide or block (<i>d</i>)
to retain the cards at any convenient or required angle; angle-bars
and catch-pieces of brass (<i>g</i> and <i>h</i>) to secure a series of trays
firmly in place, and prevent upsetting or knocking about. For
every kind of card charging, whether in connexion with an
indicator or without, this style of single tray, capable of indefinite
expansion, is preferable to drawers or frames divided into compartments.
Each tray will hold with its guides approximately
1000 cards, and, when divided up into hundreds, any number
can be found quite rapidly.</p>

<p><b>384.</b> The guides are generally made of steel, enamelled and
figured, or from vulcanized fibre, xylonite or aluminium, bearing
the numbers stamped upon them. Every charging system of
this kind should have a set of nine guides for each thousand
numbers, numbered simply 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or having the
hundreds running progressively throughout, 100, 200, 300, 400,
etc. There should also be at least two complete sets of date
guides, numbered from 1 to 31 inclusive, a set of alphabetical
guides (for unclaimed borrowers&#8217; cards) from A to Z, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
miscellaneous guides for fines, marked 1d., 2d., 3d., 6d., etc.,
&#8220;Overdues,&#8221; &#8220;Renewals,&#8221; &#8220;Guarantors Notified,&#8221; etc. All
these are necessary for working card-charging as described in
this Chapter.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec385">385.</h4>

<p><b>385.</b> It is advisable to provide a card-sorting tray, which may
be a simple rack divided into narrow compartments representing
thousands. The compartments need not be more than an inch
wide, as the cards can lie just as easily on their edges as flat,
and with greater economy of space. Where fiction is kept in a
separate series of trays, or the book-issue cards are classed, then,
of course, some modifications will be required both in book-issue
and sorting trays.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec386">386.</h4>

<p><b>386.</b> The indicator, as a library tool, is almost entirely an
English appliance, and it is somewhat curious, considering their
love for, and extensive use of, mechanical contrivances, that
American librarians have never taken kindly to it. Various
abortive experiments have been tried at Boston and elsewhere
with indicating devices of several patterns, but the almost universal
opinion of American librarians is against indicators in any
shape or form. This holds good as regards colonial and foreign
libraries generally, though one or two Canadian and Australasian
libraries have adopted indicators of an English design. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
England, on the contrary, the invention of these appliances has
gone on unremittingly for sixty years, and there are about twenty
different varieties, each possessing its own merit or ingenuity.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec387">387.</h4>

<p><b>387.</b> An indicator is a device for indicating or registering information
about books, in such a way that it can be seen either
by the staff alone, or by the public and staff both. The information
usually conveyed to the public is some kind of indication
of the presence or absence of books, and the methods of accomplishing
this almost invariably take the form of displayed numbers,
qualified in such a way as to indicate books <i>in</i> and <i>out</i>.
Thus, small spaces on a screen may be numbered to represent
books, and their presence in the library indicated by the
space being blank, or their absence from the library shown by
the space being occupied by a card or block. Or, colours may
be used to indicate books in and out, or a change in the position
of the block representing a book. No doubt the idea of the
mechanical indicator was early evolved from the needs of the
first public libraries. The first practical application of it was in
1863, when Mr Charles Dyall, then Librarian at the Hulme
Branch of the Manchester Public Libraries, had one made for
actual use by the public and the staff. This seems to be the
very earliest English indicator, and Mr Dyall is entitled to full
credit as the pioneer inventor.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec388">388.</h4>

<p><b>388.</b> The <span class="smcap">Elliot Indicator</span>, 1870, is very fully described in
a pamphlet entitled &#8220;A Practical Explanation of the Safe and
Rapid Method of Issuing Library Books, by J. Elliot, inventor
of the system. Wolverhampton, 1870.&#8221; This pamphlet gives
diagrams and descriptions of the Elliot Indicator in substantially
the same form in which it exists at the present day. The numbers
are alongside the ticket shelves or spaces, and a specially
thick borrower&#8217;s ticket is used with coloured ends to show books
out and overdue. The indicator is a large frame, divided into
columns by wide uprights carrying 100 numbers each, which
correspond with the little shelves, formed of tin, dividing each
column.</p>

<p>There are 100 shelves and numbers in every column, and the
indicator is made in several sizes, according to the width of the
borrower&#8217;s card used. The public side is covered with glass.
The method of working is simple. The borrower scans the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
indicator till he finds the space opposite the number he wants
vacant. This indicates that the book he wants is in, and he
then hands his ticket to the assistant, stating the number of the
book he requires. The assistant enters the book number and
date of issue in the borrower&#8217;s card, and inserts it in the indicator
in the space against the number. The book is then fetched, and
before issue it is registered on a specially ruled day-sheet, by
means of a stroke, to record the day&#8217;s circulation for statistical
purposes. When the book is returned its number directs to the
space on the indicator occupied by the borrower&#8217;s card, which
is withdrawn and returned to the owner, when all liability for
fines is cleared. Overdues are detected by means of differently
coloured ends to the borrowers&#8217; cards, or the periodical examination
of the indicator. This indicator, which occupies a very
large amount of counter-space, has been, or is, in use at Wolverhampton,
Newcastle-on-Tyne and Paisley.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec389">389.</h4>

<p><b>389.</b> <span class="smcap">Cotgreave Indicator, 1877.</span>&mdash;This indicator is that
which has been most used in this country, and was the invention
of Alfred Cotgreave, then Librarian of the Wednesbury Public
Library, in 1877. An account of its structure and working from
one of the descriptive circulars issued in connexion with it will
enable anyone to gather a good idea of its appearance and use:</p>

<p>&#8220;It consists of a wooden or iron frame, fitted with minute zinc
shelves, generally 100 in a column. Upon each of these shelves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
is placed a small metal-bound ledger (3 inches &times; 1 inch), containing
a number of leaves, ruled and headed for the number of
borrower&#8217;s ticket, and date of issue, also date of return or other
items as may be required, numbered or lettered at each end, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
arranged numerically in the frames. One part of it is also
lettered for entries of date of purchase, title of book, etc. The
metal case has turned-up ends, and the numbers appear on a
ground coloured red at one end and blue at the other, one colour
showing books <i>out</i>, the other books <i>in</i>; other colours may be used
if preferred. The <i>out</i> numbers can be covered altogether with a
date slide if required. The change of colour is effected by
simply reversing the ledger in the indicator frame. The public
side of the indicator is protected by glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>modus operandi</i> is as follows: A borrower having chosen
a book from the catalogue, consults the indicator, and finding
the required number to be on <i>blue</i>, denoting <i>in</i>, asks for the book
corresponding, at the same time tendering his library ticket.
The assistant withdraws the indicator ledger, makes the necessary
entries, inserts borrower&#8217;s ticket, and reverses the ledger,
which then shows the <i>red</i> colour, signifying <i>out</i>. He then hands
out the book asked for. The borrower&#8217;s ticket will remain in
this number until he changes his book, when his ticket will, of
course, be transferred to the next number required, and the
returned number will be reversed again, showing by the <i>blue</i>
colour that the book it represents is again <i>in</i>, and is immediately
available to any other reader requiring it. The entries need not
be made at the time of issue, but may stand over until a more
convenient time.</p>

<p>&#8220;When a book is not required the ticket is returned to the
borrower, and acts as a receipt, exonerating him from liabilities.&#8221;</p>

<p>There are many ways of working this indicator in order to
obtain certain records or notifications of overdues, and nearly
every library has some modification of its own.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to trace the history of the indicator in any
further detail, because, with one exception, the forms described
comprise all that have been introduced to any extent in English
public libraries.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec390">390.</h4>

<p><b>390.</b> Another indicator which has been introduced to some
extent was invented in 1894, and has several features which may
be described here.</p>

<p>It consists of a series of wooden blocks, each of which is numbered
with 250 numbers in gilt figures, and each number has a
slot under it large enough to hold a book-card with red coloured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
or white ends, bearing the same number as the slot. These
blocks can be built into columns of 1000 with the numbers
running consecutively, the whole being lodged in a glazed
frame. This indicator differs from other varieties in having
the numbers qualified by the red or white line of the card
under the numbers to indicate books <i>in</i>; when the slot is
blank, the book is <i>out</i>. &#8220;The withdrawal of the book-card
is the method of indicating books out, and it is the union
of this card with the borrower&#8217;s card which forms the basis
of the subsequent registration. When a book is issued the
assistant withdraws the card from the recorder and places it in
the reader&#8217;s ticket, which is formed like a pocket, fetches the
book, stamps it with the date of issue, and so completes the
transaction at the moment of service. Afterwards, the readers&#8217;
pocket tickets containing the book-cards are assembled and
arranged according to classes in numerical order. They are
then posted, by book and reader numbers only, on to a daily
issue sheet or register, and the date of issue is stamped on each
book-card, if this has not already been done at the moment of
service. The conjoined book- and reader-cards are then placed
in a tray bearing the date of issue, in the order of classes and
book numbers, or in one series of book numbers as may be
needful.&#8221; In other respects this charging system resembles
the card methods described in <a href="#Sec380">Section 380</a>.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec391">391.</h4>

<p><b>391.</b> The only other indicator which is designed on an entirely
different principle from any of the foregoing is the Adjustable
Indicator proposed by the author in a paper read before the
Library Association in 1895, and published in <i>The Library</i> for
1896, with illustrations. This was a practical proposal for an
adjustable indicator in which its size should be limited by the
number of books in actual <i>circulation</i>, and not by the number
in <i>stock</i>. There is a very important point here, as a library with
a stock of 30,000 volumes would require an indicator occupying
about thirty-eight feet run of counter space. If it never had
more than 4000 volumes out at one time, these could be shown
on the limited indicator above named within a space of not more
than six or eight feet. This is a most important question, and
it is inevitable that, in many libraries where conditions and
feeling are opposed to progressive changes, this continual growth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
of indicator space will force library authorities into the serious
consideration of less crowded methods.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec392">392.</h4>

<p><b>392.</b> On the principle of limiting the indicator to one particular
class of literature, several varieties have been introduced at
Brighton, Wimbledon, Glasgow and Lewisham. So many
libraries now use indicators for Fiction only that there is some
advantage in having special appliances for the purpose. The
Glasgow indicator consists of a series of detached columns with
adjustable number-blocks representing the books, arranged so
that insertions can be made at any point. The Lewisham or
Graham indicator is an alphabetical one, and consists of an
ordinary pigeon-holed frame, into which fit small numbered
blocks of wood or metal bearing the names of authors and
similar blocks with the numbers of their works. The chief
advantage of this form is that it is self-contained, and requires
no key to enable borrowers to ascertain what are the titles of
books indicated <i>in</i>. A simple reference to the author&#8217;s name
in the ordinary catalogue enables this to be done. An indicator
on similar lines has been invented by Cotgreave, who applied
the idea to a magazine indicator.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec393">393.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>393.</b> Indicators are occasionally used for recording and indicating
the issue of the parts of periodicals, both in lending
libraries and reading-rooms. The reading-room indicator simply
shows what periodicals are in use or available, in cases where
they are kept behind a barrier instead of being spread over
tables or racks. There are examples of this indicator at the
Public Libraries of St Saviour&#8217;s, Southwark, and Finsbury.
The principle is simple. The titles of magazines are mounted
upon narrow blocks of wood, arranged loosely in columns so as
to be adjustable, within a glazed frame. The back of this frame
is open to the staff only. Against the end of each title a hole is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
drilled to take a round peg which is coloured black at one end
and white at the other. The white ends are shown when a
magazine is <i>in</i>, and when it is issued the peg is reversed to show
the black end. This indicates <i>out</i>.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec394">394.</h4>

<p><b>394.</b> As a substitute for indicators, and an approach to open
access, many libraries provide a show-case for new books on the
lending library counter, to enable readers to see the additions
as they are made. In some libraries these show-cases are not
glazed on the public side, so that the readers have the additional
privilege of examining the new books as well as merely seeing
them. Certain libraries, like Birkenhead and St George&#8217;s-in-the
East, Stepney, have whole departments of books arranged
behind wire or glass within seeing distance of the readers, and
they have the option of choice by bindings and titles, which, if
not much better, is as good as choosing from catalogue entries,
and at any rate gives the semblance of freedom and closer touch
with the books.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec395">395.</h4>

<p><b>395.</b> At one time a considerable controversy, often conducted
with surprising feeling, raged in England over the respective
merits of indicator and open access methods. This continued
from about 1894, when James Duff Brown inaugurated the safe-guarded
open shelf plus card-charging method at Clerkenwell
(now Finsbury Central) Library. His liberalizing action
necessarily threatened the property of those who owned indicator
patents&mdash;some of them librarians unfortunately&mdash;and an
astonishing number of objections to each method were then
discovered by the advocates of either (some of them honest).
The younger librarians will have none of this controversy. It
is a purely impersonal question as to which is the better system,
and the gradual extension of the open access system seems to
have settled the matter in its favour. It is clear that with
advancing education the public will question the right of the
libraries to erect barriers, however ingenious and practical,
between the books and their readers. All that it seems necessary
to say here is that librarians should be able to examine both
systems in actual working, study the results obtained, and form
their own conclusions without having their integrity or morality
challenged because of their conclusions.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI<br />
<span class="title">BOOK DISTRIBUTION</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec397">397. Branch Libraries.</h4>

<p><b>397. Branch Libraries.</b>&mdash;Branch libraries are included in this
division, because as a general rule they are principally lending
libraries with a reading-room attached, and rarely possess reference
departments. Every large town extending over a wide
area must sooner or later face the question of establishing branch
libraries, not only as a convenience to the public, but as a relief
to the central library. No rule can be laid down as to the distance
which any reader should be from the nearest branch or
other library. It is one thing to make a symmetrical plan on
paper, showing a central library with a ring of branches situated
at regular distances, and so placed as to bring every reader within
one, half or quarter of a mile of the nearest library, but it is quite
a different matter realizing this ideal. Topographical difficulties
arise; the matter of density of population must be considered;
and, to crown all, sites or suitable premises cannot always be
obtained at, or near, the places selected, as the ideal spots. For
these reasons regular spacing can rarely be achieved in the
provision of branch libraries.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec398">398.</h4>

<p><b>398.</b> A branch library differs from a delivery station in being,
to some extent, a miniature central library, carrying its own
stock of books, and having its own reading-room accommodation
and magazines. A delivery station need not necessarily
have a stock of books, beyond those sent in response to applications,
and it would have no reading-room whatsoever. Branches
and deliveries are often confused, no doubt because both provide
for book distribution, but beyond this common feature all resemblance
ceases. The question of the amount and kind of
accommodation which it is desirable to provide depends entirely
upon funds, conditions and requirements. For most situations
in which branches are necessary, such as the suburbs of large
towns, the minimum provision should include a lending department,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and general reading-room for periodicals. Very occasionally
a reference department is provided, but few systems will
bear the cost of providing more than one such department, and
that at the central library; but every branch should have a
collection of quick-reference books which answer everyday
questions and afford such information as is needed in every
library. Such a collection does not necessarily require a separate
room, because that requires special oversight, but it is better to
place it in a convenient recess of the reading-room or vestibule,
where it is under the observation of the staff, and where it is
not necessary for the reader to pass through the wickets or
other barriers of the lending department in order to make use
of it. All kinds of extra features can be added to these provisions,
if necessary, but these will depend upon funds; but a
lecture room is especially valuable in a branch, as it is usually in
an area ill-provided with such accommodation and one in which
lectures, exhibitions, etc., can be given most profitably. Modern
experience also advocates children&#8217;s departments at branches,
as the suburbs are the nursery districts of most towns, and therefore
the most fruitful opportunities for work with children are
afforded in them. Some of the branches at Manchester, Birmingham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
Liverpool, Croydon, Coventry, Edinburgh, Bristol,
Islington, Lambeth, Sunderland and Fulham are models of what
such establishments should be.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec399">399.</h4>

<p><b>399.</b> It is impossible to lay down any rules for guidance as
regards the financing of branches, beyond the general recommendation
that they should never be developed at the expense
of the central library. It is better to have one efficient library
in a town than several inefficient ones, as is the case in some towns
where this wholesome principle has been forgotten or ignored.
Librarians are justified in taking a strong stand upon this point
against the unreasonable demands of ward committee representatives,
who are sometimes bent upon getting everything they can
for their own particular district irrespective of the claims of the
system as a whole. Separate account should be kept of all
moneys expended upon each branch. Receipts should also be
separately accounted for, and the central library should receive
a daily or weekly statement of all cash intromissions, issues,
occurrences, etc. Such statements can either be rendered upon
specially ruled sheets or post-cards, or kept in books according
to some such form as shown in <a href="#Fig150">Fig. 150</a>. All forms, books,
etc., at the branch should correspond with those of the central
library, and everything affecting administration stated throughout
this book applies, though in a modified degree, to branch
work.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec400">400.</h4>

<p><b>400.</b> In the selection of books for branches the same principles
should be applied as previously advocated, namely, the endeavour
to get a high average of quality and utility in the literature added
and the determination to discard useless books when the time
comes. But an effort should be made to vary the contents of
branch libraries so as to obtain as catholic and representative
a stock as possible. With Fiction, of course, this is not so easy,
especially in the case of popular novels by well-known writers,
but in other classes this can be done frequently. For instance,
if the north branch has So-and-So&#8217;s <i>Chemistry</i>, there is no reason
at all why, all things being equal, the south branch should not
have Someotherbody&#8217;s <i>Chemistry</i> and the east branch Someone-else&#8217;s.
Of course it is assumed that these are all text-books of
fairly equal merit. As every library should possess a union
catalogue showing the whereabouts of every book in the library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
system, and as borrowers&#8217; tickets should be interchangeable all
over the town and not limited to one particular library, this
arrangement of different books on similar subjects widely enlarges
the borrower&#8217;s field of choice. If the central and branch
libraries are all interconnected by means of the telephone, as
they ought to be, a borrower at the north branch can ascertain
if Someotherbody&#8217;s <i>Chemistry</i> is available without going himself,
and can easily arrange by waiting a day or shorter time to
have the book delivered at the nearest branch. At Croydon a
system of interchange effected by means of the municipal tramways,
which carry parcels of books free, reduces the waiting for
a book at another library to about thirty minutes. Such systems
of interchange are a great convenience in many cases, and place
the entire resources of the library at the command of readers,
no matter where they may live.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec401">401. Delivery Stations.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>401. Delivery Stations.</b>&mdash;A delivery station is a place which
may or may not have a small deposit collection of books&mdash;generally
not&mdash;and is meant to supply readers in thinly populated
districts and to be the forerunner of an orthodox branch to
be established when the district develops. Such stations are
usually a post-office, school, police station, or shop, which may
be induced to carry out the necessary charging, etc., sometimes
at a small remuneration. At the very best a delivery station
in a town is but a makeshift substitute for a branch, and, from
the borrowers&#8217; point of view, does not afford a very satisfactory
or expeditious service. If books which are wanted are not <i>in</i> at
the central library, considerable delay and trouble are caused.
Borrowers are compelled to make out long lists of the books they
desire to read, and as often as not these are all out at the central
store. As delivery stations seldom carry a stock of books from
which an alternative choice can be made, borrowers are driven
to the task of making out new lists or taking anything the delivery
attendant can get by telephone, if there is this kind of communication,
which is not generally the case; and as delivery
stations are frequently managed by any untrained person obtainable,
the reader gets very little help in solving real difficulties.
Apart from all this, a day must elapse, as a rule, before any book
wanted can be obtained, even if it is available, and for these
reasons the establishment of book-delivery stations is not advisable
save in remote and inaccessible parts of a large town, when
every other method of giving a local service has been found impracticable.
A highly organized system of delivery stations
with frequent motor deliveries might, however, be made effective
in scattered suburbs, but although such a system has been suggested,
we have no record of a successful British example.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec402">402. Travelling Libraries.</h4>

<p><b>402. Travelling Libraries.</b>&mdash;Of much greater importance are
travelling libraries, which can be made to serve every purpose
of delivery stations, with the great additional advantage of
furnishing, in part, the same alternative selection of books as a
branch library affords. These libraries are much used in the
United States, and take the form of boxes of books numbering
from fifty upwards, which can be deposited at fixed points in
towns and rural districts, where borrowers can attend and make
a choice of reading matter. Boxes of books by this plan can be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
sent to the care of responsible persons in all parts of a town, and
these persons can undertake the local delivery and collection of
the books, either for a small fee or as voluntary sub-librarians.
Various kinds of records are necessary to keep track of the
boxes and their contents and where and to whom they travel.
Until lately very little of this kind of work had been done either
in the United Kingdom or America, although the Americans
are gradually developing systems of rural travelling libraries
and town &#8220;home&#8221; libraries. The travelling libraries of the
States of New York and Wisconsin form a most interesting study,
as also do the &#8220;home&#8221; libraries of the city of Boston. Lately
this matter has been given a considerable impetus through the
Carnegie United Kingdom Trust, which has established experimental
rural library schemes in various parts of the kingdom in
connexion with County Councils and, more infrequently, suitable
municipal centres. Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, the
counties of Dorset, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, Wiltshire,
Cumberland and Westmorland have all such schemes in operation
or have undertaken them. These have a central deposit
library and circulate boxes of books at frequent intervals to the
villages and towns in the area, in which the clergy, teachers and
others act as honorary sub-librarians. In this way the people
who are not at present touched by the public libraries are being
brought into the fold. The matter is in the experimental stage,
and is jeopardized by the fact that, in England at least, the
County Councils have no express powers to provide libraries;
but results of the most promising kind have already been obtained,
and the day is no doubt at hand when the traditional idea
of the function of a public library as a store from which literature
is doled out to the people, <i>if they know what they want</i>, will be
superseded by a very pronounced missionary spirit, and an
endeavour to make known in every possible way the value of
all kinds of books to all kinds of people.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec403">403. Subscription Departments or Book Clubs.</h4>

<p><b>403. Subscription Departments or Book Clubs.</b>&mdash;In some of
the older municipal libraries subscription departments or book
clubs have been established, as a means of increasing the stock
of a library, without much expense. Such departments exist
at Bolton, Burton, Dewsbury, Dundee, Elgin, Leek, Tynemouth,
Wednesbury and Workington. They are operated as follows:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
For a certain annual subscription any library reader or townsman
may join this select library. From the subscriptions so
received, supplemented in some places by occasional grants
from the rate, new books are bought, generally in accordance
with the wishes of a majority of members, but on this point
practice varies. For one year these books are at the service of
subscribers only, who borrow them in the usual way, for a fortnight
or other periods according to circumstances. At the end
of the year each book is transferred to the public library, and
becomes the property of the library authority for the use of all
borrowers. Where the selection is made with discretion, this
may seem an economical way of obtaining books for a public
library, and there is much to be said in its favour in present
circumstances; but objections have been raised. Public
libraries, it is argued, have no right to set up a privileged class
in this way, especially as it is probable that the subscriptions
cannot pay all the cost of service, lighting, housing, etc.; thus
a proportion of the cost of maintenance falls on the library funds,
and it is doubtful if in the end there is much gain in receiving as
a <i>quid pro quo</i> a number of stale and, perhaps, not very judiciously
selected books; and, further, public libraries have no right to
compete with private and commercial subscription libraries for
the sake of ministering to the few people who can afford the
luxury of a select public library to themselves.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec404">404.</h4>

<p><b>404.</b> Another form of subscription is occasionally indulged in
by public libraries. By paying a certain subscription to large
commercial libraries, like Mudie&#8217;s, they are entitled to borrow
so many volumes at a time, and these are re-issued to the borrowers
in the ordinary way, the library being responsible for
losses. In small libraries this is often an economical way of
obtaining the temporary loan of copies of expensive books for
which there is a large transient demand, and in this way the
people have immediate access to books which might otherwise
never be bought, or only obtained in second-hand form long after
their interest had faded. The only trouble about this arrangement
is that it depends upon the mood of the said commercial
libraries for its continuance. To what extent these would endure
a constant drain from a hundred or so municipal libraries
remains to be seen, as also does the problem of how they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
meet the demand when it attained large dimensions. At one
time certain of the London commercial libraries absolutely
refused to lend books to public libraries on any terms. Now
they are more complaisant.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec405">405. Inter-Library Exchanges.</h4>

<p><b>405. Inter-Library Exchanges.</b>&mdash;This is a method of book
distribution which has not been tried to any extent among
British municipal libraries, and some organization would be
required to place it on a working basis. Briefly, the idea is to
enable a public library which has not got a particular book, to
borrow it from some library which has, assuming all the responsibility
for its safety and due return; and making its own
arrangement with its borrower for the cost of carriage. This
kind of exchanging could be managed better in London than
elsewhere, but it could be applied to any group of libraries, such
as those of Lancashire, Wales, Yorkshire, Staffordshire, etc.
Each exchanging library would require to possess a complete
set of class lists and bulletins, or other catalogues, of all the
other libraries, and when a demand was made for a book which
was not in its possession, the assistant could look through the
catalogues of the other libraries till he found a copy, and it could
then be written for, the borrower paying all resulting expenses.
Of course, this arrangement would only apply to non-fictional
works. There would be an undoubted advantage, too, if such a
privilege could be obtained for public library borrowers from
some of the older proprietary libraries with huge stocks of
practically unused books which municipal libraries would not
buy in the ordinary course. Arrangements whereby books from
special scientific or other libraries could be borrowed for the use
of local borrowers would also be an arrangement, could it be
managed, which would benefit a greater number of students and
other persons than at present. But, of course, there would be
very serious difficulties in the way of inducing the owners of
valuable special libraries to lend books for the use of strangers
introduced by municipal library authorities. Meanwhile, because
of these difficulties thousands upon thousands of valuable and
useful books are lying idle and neglected in every part of the
country, a waste of power which it is sad to contemplate.</p>

<p>A modification of this idea is the arrangement now made
between a few towns whereby readers from the one who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
visiting the other, who have been vouched for as being in good
standing by their own library, are permitted to borrow books
from the library in the town visited. Such an arrangement
exists between Brighton and Croydon, Waterloo has a similar
scheme, and possibly other places, and these have given much
satisfaction. The main difficulty is that few inland libraries can
give a full return to libraries in pleasure or health resorts, but
perhaps too much emphasis should not be laid upon the necessity
for an absolute return of service.</p>

<h2>DIVISION XII<br />
THE REFERENCE DEPARTMENT</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVII<br />
<span class="title">GENERAL REFERENCE LIBRARY METHOD</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec407">407. Character and Scope of the Department.</h4>

<p><b>407. Character and Scope of the Department.</b>&mdash;The reference
library is the communal study, bureau of information, and
muniment house, when it is developed to its full possibilities.
A definition of reference work turns upon a definition of a
reference book to a large extent, and it is not easy to give more
than an approximate one. A reference book is one which is
consulted to obtain some particular fact or matter from it and
not one that is read through as a whole. All works in dictionary,
encyclop&aelig;dic, chronological, periodical and similar forms are of
this character. But any book which may be consulted in the
way indicated is also legitimately a reference book. Further,
all literary and graphic material which may so be consulted,
whether in MSS., printed, photographic or other form, is rightly
a part of such a library. The encyclop&aelig;dic work is therefore
the basal stock of the department; and standard treatises on
every branch of literature, whether in actual reference form or
not; the definitive editions of the classics, as for example
the Variorum Shakespeare, must be included. Transient or
permanent small reference material, such as pamphlets, magazine
articles, broadsides, news-clippings, trade catalogues, illustrations,
maps, etc., should all find a place in it; in fact, much of the most
valued information work is done with the aid of such small
material; important facts are frequently found in seemingly
insignificant material; and the work of bringing it in relation
to other similar material is one of the first-class services of the
reference library.</p>

<p>From such a statement of the nature of the stock the purpose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
of the department may be deduced. Primarily, as its name
implies, it is a place where references to books are made; but,
although this is primary, it is too limited a statement of the
functions of the department. In it continuous reading, research,
and prolonged study are all carried on, and if a library does not
provide facilities for these it is to that extent inefficient. These
considerations give rise to certain necessary arrangements, the
first of which is freedom of access to quick-reference material.</p>

</div>

<p class="largeillo"><a href="images/illo394lg.png">Fig. 152 enlarged</a></p>

<p class="blankbefore">In the arrangement of the library building it is essential that
the most quiet part of the building which is accessible to the
public should be devoted to the reference department. It
should be a room which in its design and proportions is dignified,
and produces by these things and its furnishing and decorations
an atmosphere conducive to mental tranquillity and study. It
is impossible to define such an atmosphere, but it exists in all
really successful reference libraries, and these may be studied
at most of our great cities and towns, as at Bristol, Birmingham,
Liverpool, in the British Museum, and elsewhere. The decorations,
for example, if there are any beyond the merely architectural,
such as painted ceilings, walls, etc., should indeed be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
artistic, but are appropriate only when they are restrained, inobtrusive,
and do not divert readers from the main purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
the room or encourage visitors to come merely to stare at them.
Some reference libraries, built on ecclesiastical models, have
stained-glass windows which are beautiful features, but the same
principles apply in this form of decoration.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec408">408. Furniture.</h4>

<p><b>408. Furniture.</b>&mdash;The library furniture must depend upon the
size, shape and lighting of the room, but the alcove system, as
it exists at the Bodleian and similar older libraries, has never
been surpassed from the point of view of <i>study</i>, although it is
possibly not so good as the rotunda of the British Museum, or
that of the Library of Congress, and the Picton Reading Room
at Liverpool, for merely reference purposes. Again, the alcove
system occupies more space than one in which the cases are
fixed against the walls and arranged in other parts of the room
to secure the maximum of shelf accommodation. As regards
tables and seating accommodation the older reference departments
in municipal libraries has usually been defective in that
they merely allowed seats at long tables, with about twenty-four
inches of sitting space and a half of a two- or three-foot table
in front, often with provision, equally scant, for a reader to sit
opposite. The reference reader requires not only isolation, to
a considerable extent, as is provided at the British Museum, but
plenty of space in which to spread out his books and papers.
Moreover, nothing is more disconcerting and uncomfortable to
a reader than the unpleasant proximity of other people, and no
student or reader who makes extracts, or has to wrestle with
obstinate facts in history, science or philology, can do so if he
is environed by others similarly or otherwise engaged, at very
close quarters. This is recognized in the British Museum and
similar libraries, where each reader has what is virtually a desk
to himself so constructed as to secure the maximum of privacy.
The provision of small, self-contained separate tables as described
in <a href="#Sec161">Section 161</a> is probably the best that can be made. These
not only give plenty of space at the top, but also provide a
definite amount of space for books, etc., under the tables themselves.
For the consultation of elephant folios and similar very
large books the special slope outlined in <a href="#Fig33">Fig. 33</a> and described
in <a href="#Sec153">Section 153</a> is a reasonable and necessary provision. One or
two large flat tables for use in special cases are also to be desired.</p>

<div class="figc600" id="Fig153">
<img src="images/illo396.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="436" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 153.</span>&mdash;The Islington Reference Library. Note the special tables.</p>
</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec409">409. Access.</h4>

<p><b>409. Access.</b>&mdash;For successful reference work a certain
measure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
of open access is essential, and is allowed by most libraries which
otherwise are arranged on the closed system. The British
Museum, Birmingham and other large reference libraries allow
readers free choice from a selected assortment of books, numbering
from a few to 20,000 or more volumes, of quick-reference
character, including atlases, gazetteers, dictionaries, directories,
encyclop&aelig;dias, codes, etc., which answer everyday questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>
and which are wanted without delay. These, in themselves,
form a fairly considerable reference library, and that fact should
be recognized when the question of access is under consideration.
Other libraries allow freedom of access to nearly the whole
collection; but none allows it to the whole. There are in many
libraries unique books, records, and other works to which access
is wisely limited, in the interest of their preservation as records
and from other points of view. These, however, form an infinitesimal
part of the stock of average municipal collections.
All it is wished to emphasize here is that open access without
any formality whatever should be allowed to the obvious quick-reference
works of the kind enumerated above. A much-occupied
business man who wants an address, the definition of a
word, or a cable code is not likely to endure the bother of filling
up application forms patiently; and to insist upon it may mean
the loss of the patronage of a valuable class of the community.
For the general part of the reference library where open access
is in vogue admission is usually gained by signing the visitors&#8217;
book. Such signing has not definite safeguarding value, but is
to some extent a moral check upon would-be defaulters, and is
useful as a means of registering the number of readers. The
plans given in <a href="#Page_99">Chapter VII.</a> give some idea of the disposition of
the ordinary reference library, and no one plan can be called the
best. All that can be affirmed positively is that ample reading
space should be allowed, that good light, natural and artificial,
and ventilation, ease of administering the stock, close classification
and the fullest cataloguing possible should be aimed at.
The commonest error, as we have hinted, is crowding and insufficiency
of seating accommodation. A well-administered
reference library creates its own reading public, and accommodation
which may be ample at the opening of the library
often proves in a few years to be inadequate.</p>

shelves every morning, and notes any slips still remaining which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>
represent books issued on the previous day. To facilitate this
operation a differently coloured slip may be used on alternate
days&mdash;white to-day, blue to-morrow&mdash;so that on a white day
the presence of a blue slip will instantly draw attention to a
misplacement or a missing book. In other libraries the slips are
filed near the point of issue, and remain there as a check against
the shelves and the readers until the books are returned. Some
libraries return the slips to the borrowers as a receipt, and
compile their statistics from the books; others retain the slips
and make up their statistics from them. Some libraries also
insert an issue label in the inside front of each book, which is
stamped every time the book is issued, and thus a record is
made of a book&#8217;s popularity or otherwise, which should prove
useful when discarding has to be considered. Application forms,
or for that matter signatures in visitors&#8217; books, are no protection
against thefts of books. Readers have simply to give a false<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
name and address, and walk off with any book they please, if
they intend theft.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec410">410.</h4>

<p><b>410.</b> It is the common practice in open access reference
libraries to have notices displayed of this nature:</p>

<div class="sign1 sstype">
<p><b>Readers are requested not
to return books to the shelves
when they have done with
them, but to close them and
leave them on the table.</b></p>
</div>

<p class="noindent">Or, they may be required to return them to the assistant; in
any case it is better for readers not to return them to the shelves
personally. Either of the methods recommended enables the
staff to make records of the use of books. The consultations can
be entered up in a rough-ruled and classified book kept for the
purpose, and the staff can replace the books at once. It will be
recognized that complete statistics are practically impossible in
open access departments, because only books so left on the tables
or taken to the tables can be counted; but much valuable work
is done by readers in the shape of rapid consultations at the
shelves with immediate replacing of the volumes consulted.</p>

<p>Whatever may be his general method, the wise librarian will
never limit a reader to one or any number of books at a time.
Sometimes a dozen&mdash;we have known fifty&mdash;books are required
to settle a comparatively small point. They are forthcoming
in a good reference library. Students of recognized regularity
may even be released from overmuch form-filling; fifty forms for
the fifty books we have named would be an interminable demand.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec411">411. The Stock.</h4>

<p><b>411. The Stock.</b>&mdash;The building-up of a reference stock demands
the highest skill and prevision in the librarian. The purpose
which it is intended to serve must be clearly before his eyes,
and this may, and does, differ with differing places. A library
in a distinctly commercial and industrial area faces needs
obviously different from one in a purely residential area. But
in all libraries every kind of dictionary and encyclop&aelig;dia, general
and special, philological, technical, scientific and historical, is a
prime requisite. On these the stock will be balanced with a view<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
to procuring the best and latest statement of knowledge in every
field. This end the too-often neglected bibliographical collection
subserves. Every general and special bibliography from the
British Museum catalogue to the small select catalogues issued by
local libraries, every index, every special catalogue, indeed every
catalogue within reason of other libraries which a librarian can
procure, is a necessary tool in building up the collection and in
tracking information when it is complete. There have been
many select bibliographies, but there is still room for many more.
The average bibliography of a subject is not selected; it aims
at completeness, and seems to assume that its users are people
who want to spend a lifetime on the subject. There are such,
no doubt, but to the average reader it presents a formidable
if not paralysing array of entries. What is needed, both from
experts and from libraries, is a series of very brief lists which
contain only the best books given in order of their value, comprehensiveness,
historical character, and so on. Knowledge of
bibliographies and the methods of using them is the chief part
of the equipment of the reference librarian.</p>

<p>In this work there are two ideals, as was shown when the
general question of book selection was under consideration:
one the museum ideal, in which every kind of book of every
age is collected; the other which limits the stock to books of
proved or probable utility to the population served. The former
is the business of the national libraries and those of the great
centres of population, such as Glasgow, Birmingham, Liverpool,
Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, etc., and to a certain
extent those which are at great distance from such large centres;
and special libraries within their own fields should be exhaustive.
But this ideal is not for other libraries, except in so far as it
applies to the local collection; that should contain everything
of whatever value. Otherwise the live book is what is wanted.
The ordinary reference library should therefore be revised
periodically, obsolete and dead stock should be discarded, and
no book should be included because it does not appeal to lending
library readers or has been received as a gift for which there
seems to be no other depository&mdash;these are emphatically books
to be excluded. With these general provisions a brief survey
of the principal requirements of the stock may have its uses.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">This conspectus is not necessarily complete, nor is all the
material named of equal value or equally in demand; but every
librarian should review these headings in relation to his reference
department. To place rigid limits upon the stock is absurd,
seeing that utility and not mathematical or other precision is
the object of the work. If, therefore, a librarian finds some
other special field of material is demanded he should add it
without hesitation if he is convinced that the demand is not
frivolous or very restricted. For example, to add an expensive
and recondite (say) arch&aelig;ological treatise in Modern Greek at
the behest of one reader is a case in which his decision might
wisely be for refusal.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec412">412. Classification.</h4>

<p><b>412. Classification.</b>&mdash;In its classification the reference library
presents more physical problems than the lending library. The
most minute classification is the best undoubtedly, and this
should be used; but the size problem is a real one. While the
greater number of reference books are of octavo size, quartos,
folios, and even larger books are many. They cannot stand
together in class sequence without an impossible loss of space.
The simplest method is to have three sequences, for octavos,
quartos and folios respectively, in appropriately sized shelves, in
three different parts of the room. But this means various
journeys across the room when all the books on a subject are
required. The distance is abbreviated if the octavos, quartos
and folios follow one another in each class. A third method
which has proved most successful is to divide every tier (which
is presumed to have adjustable shelves) into three parts and to
run three parallel sequences in each, the octavos occupying the
top part, the quartos the middle, and the folios the bottom.
The parallel can be only approximate, but it is sufficiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>
close for the reader or the staff to review any subject completely
and readily. With any of these methods broken order may be
resorted to if it is thought well. The arranging of all quick-reference
books in a separate complete sequence nearest the
entrance or the place of service is a case in point; and special<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span>
separate classifications may well be given to periodicals, to local
literature, to the predominating industry, and so on without
limit. Again, convenience is the supreme law.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec413">413. Cataloguing.</h4>

<p><b>413. Cataloguing.</b>&mdash;The catalogue of the department should
aim at the maximum of fulness and be in as many forms as are
necessary to bring out the entire resources of the department;
there should be no retrenchment of time or labour in producing
the best here, as a small collection of books adequately catalogued
will give greater service than a larger one catalogued poorly.
It is not an unfair paradox to say that the smaller (within reason)
a reference library is the more detailed should be its catalogue.
This being so, whatever kind of catalogue may publish the basal
stock, the general current needs of the library can be kept
supplied only by a card or slip catalogue of unlimited expansibility.
The reference catalogue, even for books already in
stock, can rarely be complete, and any fixed form of printed
catalogue, unless it is supplemented by a MS. catalogue, will
soon fail signally as a guide to the collection. As to the cataloguing
form, experience proves that a mere author catalogue
has a very limited value in reference work. It should be provided
in some form, of course, but for one reader who inquires
for a book by its author, a score require something about
subjects, usually specific subjects such as the Horse, Verdun,
Violin strings, Election Law, Tithes, Date of a Battle, Arms
of Sussex, Birthplace of Douglas Haig, Words of a Poem, etc.
There must therefore be some form of subject catalogue, and
there is much virtue in the fully classified card or sheaf catalogue,
with author and subject indexes. These, if carried out efficiently
and minutely, will do the work that is required. By fulness of
entry we mean that titles should be abbreviated as little as is
possible within common-sense limits; that all bibliographical
particulars, number of volumes, size, pagination, date, illustrations,
maps, diagrams, glossaries, indexes, bibliographies and
date and places of publication (except when London) should be
indicated. Moreover, annotations of obscure books, and indicating
sequences, commentaries, missing parts, and so on, are
of special value here. Added entries may, and should, be carried
as far as the cataloguing resources of the library allow, all books
of composite character, miscellaneous works, transactions, many
periodicals, etc., being analysed and displayed in the catalogue<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>
under their class headings. It is also most useful to collect in
the catalogue references to bibliographies of all kinds contained
in works which are in the lending library. For examples, the
Home University Library and the Cambridge Manuals of Science
and Literature are not books to be found in the average reference
library, but they contain excellent little select bibliographies
which the reference librarian will find useful, and an entry of
each of these should be made. Every item which goes into the
library should be catalogued, pamphlets and excerpts from
other works, however small, included, if it is intended to preserve
them, as well as maps. Photographs and prints probably need
a separate catalogue, as certain considerations, dealt with later
on, enter into their cataloguing, but in a card catalogue provision
can be made for nearly every kind of material. Temporary
material may be entered on a coloured card, which permits of
rapid revision of the entries.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec414">414. Pamphlets.</h4>

<p><b>414. Pamphlets.</b>&mdash;Pamphlets and magazine excerpts form a
large part of every reference library and are often difficult to
deal with effectively. When not bound in volumes, they may
be stitched in manila wrappers, and stored in boxes of various
sizes, such as 8vo, 4to, etc., of the kind specified in <a href="#Sec306">Section 306</a>.
Each pamphlet should be lettered on the side of its wrapper,
with its author, title, date, class letter and number and accession
number. The collection might be commenced with an 8vo box
for each class, and gradually extended from this nucleus as the
stock increased, the contents of boxes being divided and subdivided,
and placed in new boxes with changed lettering. As
these would be arranged in class order, there would be no more
difficulty in finding a single pamphlet than in finding a book.
With miscellaneous collections of pamphlets bound in volumes,
the best plan is to renumber them in a progressive series, and
carry the volume number against the catalogue or other entry.
It is not advisable to run more than one series of numbers, and
if by chance a collection is acquired which is already numbered,
these should be covered over with the continuation numbers of
the library&#8217;s own progressive series. On the whole it is better
not to bind pamphlets, partly owing to their miscellaneous
nature, which prevents any real classification or even approximate
subject order in the volumes composed of them, partly because
of their very temporary value as a rule and because of the impossibility
of inserting new ones into bound volumes. A student or
discoverer frequently advances his first conclusions in a pamphlet,
and sooner or later these are superseded by books, and many
pamphlets are merely statements of views upon political and
other questions of much immediate but usually quite passing
interest. In the average library they become dead stock in a
few months or years. Pamphlet collections should be weeded
out more frequently than book collections.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec415">415.</h4>

<p><b>415.</b> The vertical file is the most adequate method of dealing
with cuttings, broadsides and similar separate matter. If the
folders are closely classified, the ordinary printed index to the
classification scheme used is a fairly good key; but a slip index
of some kind will exhaust the file better and accelerate reference.
If a brief index entry is made before the cutting is dropped into
its folder, in some such form as follows, the work will not be
unduly burdensome:</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec416">416. Accessories.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>416. Accessories.</b>&mdash;Every means of comfort and every reasonable
aid to study should be given to readers. We have dealt
with reading tables. The chairs deserve almost equal consideration.
They should be comfortable; an arm-chair is better
than other forms. The view at one time expressed that seats
without backs in some way induced to mental alertness was
that of some stupid theorist; as a matter of fact ease of body is
essential to elasticity of mind. Chairs should have rubber tips
or silent castors to prevent the nerve-racking scritching which
moving chairs too frequently make, but when metal castors are
used they should not be of the slippery variety that slides readers
unexpectedly on to the floor. Reading stands with clips for
holding books open should be on every table, or provided in
sufficient numbers to meet all probable needs. At certain tables
the use of ink should be permitted, and blotting pads, ink, pens,
etc., should be provided. Tracing may be permitted from most
illustrated books, prints, etc., but as a protection a sheet of
xylonite should be available and the reader be required to interpose
it between the copy and his tracing paper. Sheets in several
sizes should be kept for use with books of different sizes. Rulers,
<span class="lettsymb">T</span> squares, a map measurer, a reading glass, compasses, etc., may
all reasonably form part of the equipment and be lent on request.
Scrap paper for notes, both at the catalogues and at the tables,
is another reasonable provision, as is a small stock of foolscap
which readers may purchase at cost price. Some libraries have
the rule that letters must not be written in the room, and it has
its uses, as cases are not unknown where nomadic business men,
election agents, etc., have monopolized tables for hours or days
for the distinctly non-literary and non-library purpose of addressing
circulars; but the writing of occasional correspondence, if
it does not exclude other readers from the writing tables, may
safely be winked at. Other libraries do not allow the reading<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">[392]</a></span>
of other books than those from the shelves in the department,
but the absurdity of such a rule, if carried to its logical conclusion,
is patent. It may not be superfluous to add that every
reference library should be equipped with a stand for hats, coats
and umbrellas, but readers may be warned by notice that the
library does not accept responsibility for their safety.</p>

<p>All the forces of the library stock in all departments should
be at the disposal of the reference reader; thus any book in the
lending libraries, except perhaps current novels of the popular
kind, which may be on the shelves, should be allowed to be
requisitioned, as also should any newspaper, periodical or other
material in files which may not form part of the department.
A good plan in open access libraries is to give the reference reader
a pass admitting him to consult the lending library catalogues or
shelves, but after he has selected books from them to have them
brought from the lending library by the staff. Such uses of
lending library books should count as reference consultations.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec417">417. The Lending of Reference Books.</h4>

<p><b>417. The Lending of Reference Books.</b>&mdash;Whether or not reference
library books should ever be lent away from the building
is a question upon which librarians are sharply divided. It is
argued that a reference library is a place where a reader has a
right to expect every book in stock to be available at all times,
and this is a reasonable theory. That reader, however, is a
hypothetical person as a rule, and too rigid a policy of refusal
has some disadvantages. Experience tells every librarian what
books ought not to be lent in ordinary circumstances, if in any;
and these are quick-reference books of all kinds, and any book
the loss of or damage to which would be irreparable. Occasionally,
however, a real student really requires the home use of a
reference book which is not in everyday demand, and the library
would suffer little and might gain much by lending it. If the
ordinary loan periods are thought to be inadmissible, much can
be said for lending over week-ends or at hours when the library
is inaccessible to readers. It is a question which every librarian
must settle for himself. In one successful reference library
which lends, when a reasonable cause is shown, every book not
excluded by the exceptions just named, and has done so for
twenty years without the least inconvenience, a form of application,
which is also a charging form, is used. This is a card<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>
6 inches &times; 5 inches, which folds in the middle and files as a
standard-sized catalogue card (3 inches &times; 5 inches):</p>

<p class="blankbefore">The application forms, when completed and allowed, are
filed alphabetically under the name of the borrower. There are
so few of them (probably a dozen weekly) that any other form
of charging has been found to be unnecessary. The assistant
concerned in the work examines the file weekly, and books overdue
are written for immediately. Borrowers guilty of retaining
reference books beyond the allowed time are denied the privilege
of borrowing thereafter.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec418">418. Staff.</h4>

<p><b>418. Staff.</b>&mdash;It is fair to say that there are too few reference
librarians in this country; that is to say, persons who, in addition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>
to ordinary scholarship and library technique, have trained
specially in bibliography, the drawing out of readers and information-hunting.
Perhaps as a result of the library schools
now in course of organization a race of such useful librarians will
arise. The staffing of the reference library is perhaps the greatest
difficulty a librarian has to overcome. In the larger libraries
the department is in the control of experts, or at any rate of
the most efficient workers on the staff, but in smaller towns it
falls to the keeping of an assistant, often a different person every
day or even shift, who can be spared from the general staff;
indeed, in some libraries reference work is so small that this is
all that can be afforded. In such circumstances the best work
is out of the question. The reference reader demands skilled
attention. Libraries catering for a learned or special clientele
have their own special problems; but the ordinary civic library
has, in addition to numbers of such clients, the average man and
woman to deal with who are not only unskilled in the use of
books, but have also some difficulty in making known their
actual needs. It is obviously beyond the power of a boy or girl
assistant to draw out of these readers the exact nature of their
difficulties; that is a task requiring address, sympathy and tact,
which experience alone gives. In small libraries the librarian
himself may consider it a privilege to work at busy times in this
department; it will be well worth his while. The qualifications
a reference librarian should aim to possess are a complete library
technique, an intimate knowledge of the sources of information
and of his stock, and a certain missionary spirit which loves
knowledge for its own sake. In addition he must have sympathy
with all classes of inquirers and be able to suffer fools gladly.
On the technical side he will find in certain little books a good
elementary grounding; among them is Hopkins&#8217;s <i>Reference
Guides</i>, Kroeger&#8217;s <i>Guide to Reference Books</i>, and so on. All
juniors in a reference department should go through a course
based upon these, and courses in practical book-selection and
bibliography. No question should be regarded as trivial; it is
no part of the librarian&#8217;s duty to assess the value of any information
asked; and patience even beyond what may seem reasonable
limits is an everyday requirement. For example, the
question once asked, &#8220;On which side of Cromwell&#8217;s nose
was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>
there a wart?&#8221; seemed frivolous enough, and it involved the
consulting of dozens of books; but it proved to be wanted for
the identification of what is believed to be a unique death mask.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec419">419. Records.</h4>

<p><b>419. Records.</b>&mdash;All information the sources of which were not
obvious should be recorded on cards, together with the sources
from which it was given, in order that similar search may not
be necessary when it is required again. Carbon copies of all
special lists of books compiled should be filed for future use.
Failures of the library are most important as showing
deficiencies in the collection, and questions which could not be
answered should always be recorded. When a reference library
cannot supply information from its own resources, it should endeavour
to find what neighbouring library can supply it, and
either direct the inquirer there, or, better, borrow the book
required. Mutual co-operation of this kind between libraries
is easy to arrange, and few librarians do not recognize its value.
It should always be borne in mind that to turn a reader away
empty is a loss of prestige to the library, while a reader well
served and satisfied is a potential friend and probable patron
afterwards.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec420">420. Special Library Collections.</h4>

<p><b>420. Special Library Collections.</b>&mdash;In the average town it
should be the endeavour to concentrate all the special libraries
of institutions and societies in the reference library. It is
obviously an uneconomy for special collections to be locked up
for the greater part of the week in the private rooms of institutions
and societies when they may be made available all day
and every day to the members of these societies and to the
general public in the municipal reference library. These bodies
may often be induced to deposit their collection if some simple
arrangement is made by which books may be lent as required to
their members and may be available to everybody for reference
purpose when not so lent out. By this means a useful reinforcement
of the stock is made at the expense of shelf-room and
administration only. It is usual to catalogue such collections
exactly as other parts of the stock, but to add some individualizing
symbol to the class-mark to show its ownership.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec421">421. Information Bureaux.</h4>

<p><b>421. Information Bureaux.</b>&mdash;Among the many possibilities of
the department we shall confine ourselves in this chapter to its
use as an information bureau, leaving such important considerations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>
as the Local Collection, and its auxiliaries Regional and
Photographic Surveys, and Commercial Libraries for treatment
in separate chapters. The information desk or bureau is the
name given to the department of the work which lays itself out
to answer inquiries for business and other people. It is primarily
quick-reference work and is done in proximity to the quick-reference
collection. But it goes further in the direction of
supplying such current information as the present population of
the town, its rates, etc., the addresses of burgesses, the latest
Derby winner, the cable code used by this or that firm, the plays
available at the theatres, the social or other events of this, next
or last week, and indeed any useful or convenient information
whatsoever. Much of the material needed is in the quick-reference
collection, much must be clipped from the newspapers, and
some&mdash;as, for example, the programmes of local societies&mdash;must
be sought for at first-hand. It may be objected that this information
may, to an extent, be found in newspapers by the
inquirers themselves. Admitted; but they have not always the
required newspaper at hand, and the information bureau is
always there. Briefly indexed vertical files, within hand-reach
of a public telephone, are the means of working such bureaux.
The telephone is essential to real success, and inquiries by telephone
should be invited. Where there are commercial libraries
in connexion with the library system, much of this work may be
done in them, but there is, as the examples given above show,
a large amount of work that can be done outside their field;
and a ready and efficient information bureau is a real asset to
any town.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec422">422. Indexes of Readers.</h4>

<p><b>422. Indexes of Readers.</b>&mdash;Another useful work that in large
libraries may properly be relegated to the cataloguing department
may be conducted in smaller ones by the reference staff.
This is the supplying of firms and individuals with lists of books
of use in connexion with their industry or study. Some libraries
supply such people with a small card catalogue of the whole of
their subject as it is represented in the libraries, and send cards
regularly for entries of additions. Other forms of catalogues
can be used, of course, for this purpose. In conjunction therewith,
and as a useful adjunct to other work, it is a good plan to
make card entries of the special subjects affected by individual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>
readers under the names of the subjects, and to advise the readers
by post-cards of all additions made in those subjects.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />
<span class="title">LOCAL COLLECTIONS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec424">424. General.</h4>

<p><b>424. General.</b>&mdash;Of the departments of reference, other than
the general working department, prior consideration may be
given to the Local Collection on the ground that every municipal
public library must have a collection of this kind. At any rate
it should have as complete a collection as possible of material
relating to its town. County collections are a much more
serious matter and should only be attempted by towns of county
rank, or the town in each county where the majority of the
population is. There is hardly a county in England which can
support two county collections, because rival collections are
mutually inimical, and their competition for certain items causes
the price of the latter to increase absurdly. The town is another
matter. The one place where copies of books, pamphlets, photographs,
etc., relating to a town ought to be found is its public
library; and there are several principles, warnings and suggestions
that may be enunciated in connexion with the work.
The relative value of the material to be collected is hardly a
matter for the librarian; often most despised material has
great value when brought into relation to other material. The
best general principle is: &#8220;Get everything and leave its evaluation
to posterity.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec425">425. Material collected.</h4>

<p><b>425. Material collected.</b>&mdash;Primarily the words local collection
are co-extensive with local bibliography. This last term, however,
is too narrow, and the broad headings embraced by
the collection may be set out, and then considered in detail.
These are:</p>

<ul class="nostyle">

<li>(<i>a</i>) Printed records.</li>
<li>(<i>b</i>) Written records.</li>
<li>(<i>c</i>) Pictorial records.</li>
<li>(<i>d</i>) Engraved records.</li>

</ul>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span></p>

<p>All or most of these are found in every local collection, and
their statement immediately raises the question: Can pictorial
records, although undoubtedly a part of local history, come into
the province of the library? Are they not rather in that of the
art gallery? Similarly are not engraved records (bronze coins,
tokens, rubbings of monumental brasses and seals) better placed
in the museum? It may be urged that the art gallery is concerned
with art, the museum with science, and the library (in
this connexion) with history. Pictures and engraved articles
are not collected by the librarian because of their artistic qualities&mdash;in
fact, many of his most cherished possessions are artistic
atrocities&mdash;but because they are records. On this argument a
good case can be made for their retention in the library. No
doubt, where a town has the three institutions named, and
where the local collecting spirit is at work in each, and is
definitely co-ordinated, it would be wise and economical to
sub-divide the field; but where there is only the library, there
can be only one principle, and that the one already emphasized&mdash;&#8220;get
everything.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec426">426.</h4>

<p><b>426.</b> When we come to consider the printed records of any
locality, we are surprised at their extent. These, again, can be
set out in a brief tabular form:</p>

<ul class="locality1">

<li>A. Books <i>of</i> the locality.

<ul class="locality2">
<li class="first">1. By local authors.</li>
<li>2. Locally printed.</li>
<li>3. Newspapers and periodicals.</li>
<li>4. Public material: parliamentary, legal, etc.</li>
<li>5. Public material: municipal.</li>
<li>6. Trade material.</li>
<li>7. Programmes: theatre, cinema, music hall, concert hall, etc.</li>
<li>8. Posters.</li>

<li>4. Public material: parliamentary, legal, etc.</li>
<li>5. Novels, poems, and plays with local setting.</li>
<li>6. Newspaper and periodical references.</li>
</ul><!--locality-->

</li>

</ul><!--nostyle-->

<p class="blankbefore">These headings cover a wide area, but the presence of every
form of material named is desirable in the local collection.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec427">427.</h4>

<p><b>427.</b> For the purposes of the local collection an author may
be defined as 1, a writer who is born, and educated in whole or
part, in a town, or whose family is indigenous in it; 2, residents
of some years&#8217; standing or whose works reflect the locality;
3, authors of utterances or writings made in, or upon, or addressed
to the locality; 4, public men, officials, etc.; 5, any
minister, public speaker, etc., who holds office or meetings in
the town; 6, all local bodies, public or private&mdash;the municipality,
churches, societies, clubs, etc.; and 7, all local
tradesmen&mdash;catalogues, etc.</p>

<p>It is a prime duty of every public library to collect locally
printed books; the <i>lacun&aelig;</i> in our national bibliography have
been lamentable in the past in regard to locally and privately
printed books, owing to the lack of such collecting, and they are
not likely to decrease if this duty is not vigorously undertaken
by the librarian of to-day. The search must be specially eager
for the privately issued volume, but however limited the author
intends his circulation to be, he is usually quite persuadable as
far as a copy for the local collection goes. Local newspapers, it
is obvious, are material of cardinal value. Every one of them
must be collected, bound, and to some extent indexed. And
similar if somewhat lesser value attaches to every periodical
whatsoever&mdash;be it the issue of a sect, school, institution, trader,
party, club, or any other body&mdash;published in the town. It is a
curious fact that few libraries possess, for instance, sets of the
various church magazines. These are, usually, of course, made
up of a London-published religious periodical inset in sheets
dealing with the particular church that distributes them. The
inset may be discarded, but the local part should certainly be
collected from every such periodical issued locally. Few records
are more important than this.</p>

<p>The local collection must certainly include all local acts, bye-laws,
orders in Council that have a local bearing. It is remarkable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span>
how many of these there are for even supposedly insignificant
areas.</p>

<p>Novels and other imaginative literature, which have a local
setting, come clearly into the collection. It is a curious fact
that the modern novel of this character is frequently missed.
It seems all the more important to collect it when we know that
the average &#8220;selling life&#8221; of a six-shilling novel is about six
weeks, and its public life quite often not much longer. Only
the local library can&mdash;or ought&mdash;to save much of this fiction
and imaginative writing.</p>

<p>References to the district in outside newspapers and periodicals
should always be kept. Even when they are founded on the
material in the local newspapers they are usually coloured by
the outside view, or are in better perspective than the local
writer can bring to bear upon whatever is under discussion.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec428">428.</h4>

<p><b>428.</b> The basic records of a town, and, therefore, from the
point of view of the local collection, its most important, are its
written ones; and in these, generally speaking, libraries are
most deficient, for the obvious reason that the ordinary municipal
library is a newcomer, and that in modern days the printed
record has largely superseded the written one. Not altogether,
however, as we shall see. Written records are almost of as many
types as are the printed&mdash;there are parliamentary, municipal,
parochial, private business and personal manuscripts, of which
every librarian should strive to obtain possession. A copy of
the Domesday Book for his area, albeit impossible, except by
successful burglary of the Public Record Office, would be a
desirable beginning to the collection. After that, we may tabulate
a list of the classes of written material which should be
sought:</p>

<ul class="locality2">

<li>1. Parochial Records: Tithe Registers, Parish Registers, Rate
Books.</li>

<li>2. Municipal Records: Rate Books, Assessment Registers,
Minute Books.</li>

<li>3. Private business records: Leases, indentures, agreements.</li>

<li>4. Manuscripts, autographs, etc.</li>

</ul>

<p>Parochial registers of all kinds, tax books, etc., were until
comparatively recent years kept in the charge of the Church.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>
Modern vicars have, as a rule, little interest in them, and are often
willing to hand them over to the public library. Such books
have an obvious value in resolving the whereabouts, rateable
value and occupants of various types of property; and very
interesting questions may be settled by their means. The
actual parish registers&mdash;of births, marriages and deaths&mdash;are
another matter, and the originals cannot, we believe, be transferred
to the library. In some cases the staffs of libraries have
obtained permission to transcribe these verbatim, and have
actually done so.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
It is undoubtedly a useful work, but scarcely
comes into the province of the librarian as such; his work is to
collect existing material, not to create material, although there
are infrequent exceptions to the rule. In general we must wait
until one of the publishing societies produces these registers,
and in the meanwhile refer inquirers to the Church. All we need
to emphasize here is the fact that for centuries the corporate
life centred in the Church, and it is to the Church that we must
look for our primary written records.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a>
At Walthamstow this was done by a member of the Libraries staff.</p></div>

<p>We reach somewhat surer ground when we endeavour to collect
municipal records. The older municipalities&mdash;Coventry, Stratford-on-Avon,
etc.&mdash;have had some regard for their records,
and have at least preserved them. Modern municipalities preserve
them, too&mdash;that is to say, theoretically. A visit to the
basement or attics of the average municipal building is, however,
a woeful experience for the collector. Usually, in cob-webbed
chaos, he will find the records that in a century (or much less)
will have immeasurable interest for the student of local affairs.
There are written minutes as distinct from printed ones of municipal
committees, rate, assessment, receipt, wages, work, and
numerous other books to be found in the confusion. It is not
always easy to persuade the people concerned to hand over
these books, and indeed the more recent of them probably ought
not to be handed over; but a little persuasive tact has in more
than one case secured the right of the librarian to take charge of
and to classify and catalogue them. Sometimes limitations are
placed upon their use (for example, books of the last ten years
may not be exposed to general consultation), but in any case
they ought to be secured for the collection if it is in any way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>
possible. The records, it must be mentioned, are voluminous
and bulky, and if in addition to the right of custody the municipality
can be induced to provide a room for their reception, the
relief will generally be a welcome one.</p>

<p>In some ways the most attractive of written records, the most
human, are the private ones; and these are also the most
difficult to obtain. Leases, wills, agreements, indentures, and
similar deeds are naturally not stored systematically anywhere
in the average town, and they must be searched out. Old inns
are likely places, as are old solicitors&#8217; offices, and auctions sometimes
bring them to light. There are, of course, dealers who
specialize in them, and most desirable deeds have been obtained
cheaply from London dealers. Such documents throw more
light on the changes, customs, and language of a locality than do
any of the more formal records mentioned above.</p>

<p>Local literary manuscripts, autographs, manuscripts of local
authors, letters, and similar written documents are so obviously
desirable that more than a mention of them is superfluous; but
we want, in this connexion, to urge that to-day will very quickly
belong to the past, and that the collection of these things from
the hands of living men is to be desired. When a librarian
receives a letter from the mayor, a prominent alderman, or
similar local celebrity, he does not as a rule think of it as something
to be preserved in the local collection. Why not?</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec429">429. Pictorial and Graphic Material.</h4>

<p><b>429. Pictorial and Graphic Material.</b>&mdash;In recent years librarians
have given systematic attention to the collection of pictorial
records, although, indeed, they have long been recognized as a
part of the collector&#8217;s province. These naturally divide into:</p>

<ul class="locality2">

<li>1. Painted records.</li>
<li>2. Prints.</li>
<li>3. Photographs.</li>
<li>4. Maps.</li>

</ul>

<p class="noindent">(We think we can extend the word &#8220;pictorial&#8221; to cover maps.)
The presence of painted records may be questioned, but their
value as records is undoubted, seeing that they give colour,
atmosphere, and have other interpretative values which are
absent from the more meticulously accurate photograph. Local
prints and photographs should be collected without special
regard to their artistic value; record is always the motto of the
collector, not beauty, however much we may desire it personally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span>
Care should be taken to secure photographs in a permanent
process, but it is better to have them in the more evanescent
processes, and to take special care of them, than not to have
them at all. All gas-light photographic prints (with a distinct
preference for platinotype, bromide and velox papers in this
descending order) are practically permanent; but the finest
photographic paper extant will not endure direct sunlight everlastingly.
The question of the treatment of prints and photographs
generally, however, deserves separate treatment, and
here we are concerned only with what should be collected. The
pictures, then, must represent distinctive things, interpretative
of the life of the district. Pictures of individual flowers, which
grow anywhere, trees which are not peculiar to the place, &#8220;pretty
bits&#8221; which might be matched in any place in the kingdom, are
of little or no value. Omitting these inessential things, practically
everything else from the portrait of the Member of Parliament
to that of the local am&#339;ba comes within the scope of the
collection. The cheapest print from the cheapest periodical
need not be despised. It may serve its turn.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec430">430.</h4>

<p><b>430.</b> Special endeavour should be made to secure a complete
set of the maps of the region covered. In spite of the conventionality
and inaccuracy of many early maps they are our
original source of information on many points vital to the collection.
For some counties the maps have been scheduled with
exemplary thoroughness, and by basing his collection on one of
these schedules the collector will be helped greatly, seeing that
the old cartographers usually worked on several counties, and
the map bibliography of Yorkshire, for example, may be expected
to furnish useful clues to the maps of Kent. Old gazetteers,
topographies, histories, encyclop&aelig;dias and periodicals of general
scope often contain maps, and the least prepossessing of such
works should be consulted in order to obtain them.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec431">431.</h4>

<p><b>431.</b> Engraved records are fewer than any previously mentioned.
They include local seals, crests, coins and tokens, and
similar articles. Tokens, it may not be generally known, were
coins, usually having the values of a farthing, a halfpenny, and
a penny, which local traders were permitted to issue to supply
the scarcity of a small coinage from the national treasury.
These were issued mainly from the sixteenth to the eighteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span>
centuries and generally had a local exchange value only, although
a number were accepted in many counties. Clearly these tokens,
which often carry the trade marks, signs, etc., of the trader
issuing them, are a valuable and interesting part of local material.
The Coventry Public Libraries possess what we believe to be an
unique collection of tokens relating to that city. Various local
medals should also be sought.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec432">432. Sources of Supply.</h4>

<p><b>432. Sources of Supply.</b>&mdash;There is something trite and unoriginal
in the discussion of the methods of obtaining books for
the local collection, but perhaps something useful may emerge
from a recapitulation of the principal ones. So far as the municipal
library is concerned, the common method must be by
purchase, although much will be secured from private generosity
when the collection has become known. It is important, in our
opinion, not to leave the collection unmentioned in the annual
estimates; a definite appropriation should be made for it, the
amount of which will of course depend upon the resources of the
library and upon the area covered. We have found at Croydon,
where the collection covers extra-metropolitan Surrey, that
much may be done on an appropriation of &pound;35 a year. This need
not be spent entirely upon the collection, nor should the collecting
be limited to the purchasing power of this sum, but it seems
to be very desirable to have money so ear-marked in order that
attention may be focussed upon the collection as an important
part of the activities of the library.</p>

<p>It is also essential, if the collection is to be successful, that
the librarian should have discretionary power in the spending
of the appropriation. Local literature disappears with a rapidity
that is sometimes astonishing, and keen collectors on making
discoveries in the catalogues of booksellers and dealers, usually
secure the coveted books by telephone or telegram. The library
would be a greatly handicapped competitor if the sanction of
the libraries committee had to be awaited before purchases could
be made. In some towns the discretionary power is vested in
the chairman, and where he is immediately accessible to the
librarian there are distinct advantages in this method, especially
if he is sympathetic. It is a good axiom for the librarian to avoid
responsibilities which can judiciously be distributed!</p>

<p>A certain amount of judicious advertisement of the needs of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span>
the library is desirable in this matter. Care should be taken
that a note to the effect that local material is purchased should
appear in Clegg&#8217;s <i>Directory of Booksellers</i>, and in other similar
publications. On the notepaper of the library some such note
as the following might be given in small type: &#8220;The librarian
will be glad to hear of written or printed material relating to
Selsey, either as a gift or for purchase.&#8221; This is especially useful,
as the notepaper circulates mostly in the district itself, where
much literature may be hidden, unvalued and neglected, which
its owners would willingly add to the collection. With the
directory entry before him the bookseller will generally report
individual items, but in any case he will send his catalogues, and
these must be perused diligently. As a rule the bookseller is
sufficiently master of his business to enter likely material, under
county and town headings, but not infrequently books which
have a local appeal appear in other parts of the catalogue. In
this work the librarian will naturally and wisely make use of his
whole staff, and every inducement should be held out to assistants
to help in the discovering of local material and to make suggestions
for the extension of the collection. Generally, however,
little inducement will be needed, as library workers as a
whole are both keenly interested in and proud of the local
collection.</p>

<p>Other sources of supply may be dealt with briefly. Donations
will account for many of the most curious and useful, and these
are best induced by exhibitions of material from the collection,
by references made to the collection in books in the lending
library (a slip can be inserted in all topographical books, for
example, calling attention to the existence and scope of the
collection), and by paragraphs, articles, etc., built up from local
material, which may appear in the public press, and which the
local press is only too glad to publish.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec433">433. Photographic Surveys.</h4>

<p><b>433. Photographic Surveys.</b>&mdash;The current pictorial records, the
photographs, can usually be obtained, by the expense of much
energy and little money, through a Photographic Survey Society.
As this matter has just lately received systematic and authoritative
treatment,<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
it is unnecessary here to enlarge upon it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">[408]</a></span>
further than to say that a photographic survey society is usually
a band of photographers, professional and (mainly) amateur,
who make photographic records in a systematic manner of a
particular district, its history, antiquities, natural features,
architecture, industries, current activities, and, in fact, everything
that presents or interprets its life. Such societies are increasing
in number, and have a social side in the shape of photographic
excursions, reunions, etc., which make them rather more than
gatherings where the cacophanous jargon of the dark-room pervades
everything; hence they band together many people who
are interested in a district and the preservation of its memories.
As a rule the whole of the work of the survey, except the cataloguing
and classifying&mdash;which are the business of the librarian&mdash;is
done by members of the survey. The library usually supplies
mounts, storage and cataloguing requisites.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec434">434. Regional Surveys.</h4>

<p><b>434. Regional Surveys.</b>&mdash;Similarly, but more recently, regional
(or civic) survey societies have come into existence, which parcel
out certain local areas, and study everything in them, from their
geology to the last manifestations of the human intellect working
in them, and record the results on maps.<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
Thus maps of the
local strata, water-bearing beds, flora, rainfall, industries, old
inns, milestones, boundary marks, and so on, have been made
for the circle of twenty miles, centering in Croydon. This is
a new form of work of the utmost value for providing data of
current utility, and for preserving the record of local features.
Such societies are already recognizing that the municipal reference
library is the natural storing-place of such material.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec435">435. Cost.</h4>

<p><b>435. Cost.</b>&mdash;Naturally the most important factor in collecting
is the price of the material collected. This, not remarkably,
often gives us considerable pause, as the present-day cost of local
literature does not seem to bear any relation to its original cost;
and to appraise the value of manuscript material, deeds and
similar matter, is almost impossible. Scarcity and competition
are the two factors in creating prices. In local literature the
demand can be controlled if librarians do not traverse other
fields than their own district in making their collection. A
little consultation with brother librarians should bring about a
workable division of any given county, with the result that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>
individual collection would be satisfactory, and the duplication
of effort and expense would be avoided. Only the very large
towns should attempt county collections. Moreover, this avoidance
of competition would lessen the demand for the same
book, and so help to bring down its market value. The competitor
who can completely out-distance the average library is
the keen private collector with a generous purse and unlimited
leisure. In his case the librarian can only hope that his will
contains a clause in which his collection and the library are in
happy juxtaposition. With relation to actual buying, it is a good
axiom never to purchase anything except &#8220;on approval.&#8221; It is
really wonderful how attractive a commonplace and almost
valueless item can appear to be in an agent&#8217;s catalogue. In few
cases this &#8220;sending on approval&#8221; is refused by booksellers, but
the majority are only too glad to do it, especially if the prospective
purchaser undertakes to pay postage both ways in the
event of rejecting the material. By this means large bundles
of stuff which have only a nucleus of useful matter can be weeded
out, and the price arranged according to the result. This is
particularly desirable when dealing with deeds, which often
prove to be incomplete, or of far less interest than (say) the
entry, &#8220;Forty Surrey Deeds, 1542-1816,&#8221; would imply. One
does not suppose that dealers in these things are one whit less
honest than other men, but their prices are often in the region
of the absurd. If the collector has reason to think that this is
so, he should make a reasonable offer for the books he wants,
and it will generally be found that the bookseller is amenable to
this sort of argument. Naturally we are speaking of the general
items for the collection. In every district individual items have
a definite high value which cannot be reduced, and it is the lot
of most local collectors to be compelled regretfully to pass by,
as beyond their means, many things that they would gladly
possess.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec436">436. Mounting of Prints, etc.</h4>

<p><b>436. Mounting of Prints, etc.</b>&mdash;It remains to devote some
attention to the mounting, cataloguing and storage of material.
Books and pamphlets are treated as in the general library, as are
broadsides, cuttings and similar separate material. The photograph
may be treated in various ways. At Birmingham, for
example, the prints are mounted, and stored in what are virtually<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>
loose-leaf albums, which permit perfect classification and
the insertion of any new photograph without dislocation. The
more usual method is to mount the photographs on a uniform
size mount&mdash;17 in. by 13<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. for large prints,
and 12<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in. by 10<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> in.
for smaller (and the great majority of) prints have been found
satisfactory. Nature papers of double strength have been used,
and every effort should be made to secure an acid-free paper.
When it is obtained the prints should be fixed by the dry-mounting
process, if possible; nearly all adhesives have injurious
chemical action upon photographic papers. The mounted prints
and photographs are stored in boxes such as that shown in
<a href="#Fig118">Fig. 118</a>, or in the drawers of a vertical file.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec437">437. Classification.</h4>

<p><b>437. Classification.</b>&mdash;The classification of the local collection
demands a much closer arrangement than any general scheme
provides. Up to the present most librarians have constructed one
for their own use; and there are two methods. One, and that
most readily used, is a topographical arrangement with a subject
sub-arrangement; the other is the converse&mdash;a subject
arrangement with topographical sub-division. The choice may
be determined by the answer the reader gives to the question:
Which are users more likely to want&mdash;</p>

<ul class="locality3">

<li>1. The churches of a county or town as a whole? or</li>

<li>2. Material, including the church, relating to a town (in a
county) or parish or ward (in a town)?</li>

</ul>

<p>The topographical arrangement of (say) a county survey is
usually secured by adding to the subject number the number of
the square on the key Ordnance Survey map of the county.
That is, when the main arrangement is subjectival. When it
is topographical the ordnance number precedes the subject
number. A detailed example of the working of a local collection
classification is given in Gower, Jast and Topley&#8217;s <i>The
Camera as Historian</i>.</p>

<p>Every mount should bear upon it a label showing particulars
of the subject, number, photographer, process, date, etc. This
goes well into the left-top corner. The example given is that
of the Surrey Photographic Survey. A similar label with the
necessary adaptations is advisable on all prints which are not
the property of such Surveys. In the case of surveys the label<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">[411]</a></span>
is filled in by the photographer, except the space for the class-mark,
and the upper part is detached by the Survey Secretary
and is pasted up in a guard-book to form his record. Only the
label within the thick squared lines is affixed to the mount.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec438">438. Cataloguing.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>438. Cataloguing.</b>&mdash;The cataloguing of the local collection
should, of course, follow the code in general use; but certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">[412]</a></span>
amplifications are desirable. The size, pagination, date of publication,
town of publication, and the names both of printer
and publisher (if they are different) should be given. Omissions
from titles should be as infrequent as possible, and when made
should be indicated. The object is to make this catalogue as
fully bibliographical as possible.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec439">439.</h4>

<p><b>439.</b> The cataloguing of prints is a fairly simple matter if
treated in common-sense fashion. Inquirers only occasionally
require the works of artist or photographer in connexion with
such prints as are stocked by libraries. A subject-index appears
to be the best form, with a local index; thus</p>

<p class="noindent blankbefore">are a sufficient cataloguing of a particular print. All the detail
beyond that can be found on the prints, which themselves are
in their arrangement a classified catalogue. Of course special
prints would go under the artists&#8217; names, or under their titles if
their value warranted that course. Usually it does not.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec440">440. Maps.</h4>

<p><b>440. Maps.</b>&mdash;It is appropriate to deal with maps here, as the
largest number of maps will probably be local ones. The classification
methods suggested for prints apply to maps as well; that is
to say, the predominating arrangement should be topographical,
and the sub-arrangement subjectival, and the ultimate arrangement
may be chronological. Thus a map of the geology of a
particular town would arrange&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec441">441.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>441.</b> The cataloguing of maps may follow the Anglo-American
rule, which runs:</p>

<p class="fsize80 blankbefore">Enter maps under the cartographer. If the name of the cartographer

<p class="noindent blankbefore">This simple rule needs some amplification for a large collection
of maps; and the following simple rules have been found to be
satisfactory:</p>

<p class="hind2_4 blankbefore">1. The <i>Arrangement</i> of entries is in chronological order, and
where two entries occur under one date they are arranged
alphabetically by the <i>heading</i>.</p>

<p class="hind2_4">2. <i>The Name adopted for Heading</i> is that of the cartographer
where found; where the cartographer is not found, the
publisher, or engraver, or title (in this order) forms the
entry word.</p>

<p class="hind2_4">3. The unit of <i>Scale</i> wherever possible should be the inch.</p>

<p class="hind2_4">4. Give the <i>Size</i>, measured from one inner margin to another,
vertical measurements first, to the nearest quarter-inch
below the actual size.</p>

<p class="hind2_4">5. The <i>Date</i> of arrangement is that printed on the map; but
modern maps illustrating places at a past period in history
arrange under the period, the publication date being
added to the entry merely as information. Undated
maps from atlases or other works take the date of the
work in which they appear.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">All catalogues so arranged require topographical and subject
indexes.</p>

<p><b>442. Deeds.</b>&mdash;Deeds are difficult to handle and store because
of their shape and size, the seals attached to them, and for
other reasons. For ordinary purposes flat filing in boxes similar
to those used for maps will serve. The cataloguing of deeds
has been variously done, but for local purposes a topographical
arrangement, with a chronological sub-arrangement, is recommended.

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec445">445. General.</h4>

<p><b>445. General.</b>&mdash;It is appropriate to devote a brief space to the
consideration of reference libraries of municipal material,
because the Library Association has affirmed the desirability of
such libraries; although, so far as this country is concerned,
the matter is in the prospective stage rather than that of
accomplishment. In various Canadian and American cities such
libraries exist and have proved their utility.</p>

<p>Municipal history would probably furnish many examples of
independent attempts to solve similar local government and
administrative problems, all conducted without that reference
to one another which is implied in organization, and without
full profit being derived from the successes or failures of former
workers. It is true that before carrying out schemes appeal is
made by municipalities to their official experts; but the experience
of the latter, however wide, is usually circumscribed, and
they can add to it only by personal visits to and correspondence
with, similar experts. This limited knowledge, and the expenditure
of time and money, could be avoided by any municipality
which possessed an organized library of reference material.</p>

<p>It is, as we have shown, the business of every library to preserve
in its local collection all publications of the authority to
whom it belongs. The value of this limited work is obvious, but
it does not necessarily demand a special department. When,
however, an attempt is made to collect every kind of material,
manuscript, printed, pictorial and statistical, which is likely
to throw light on problems of local administration, including
the municipal literature issued by other authorities, the task
becomes so large that a separate and self-contained department
must be devoted to it.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec446">446.</h4>

<p><b>446.</b> In almost every municipal office there is to be found a
smaller or larger collection of the more obvious technical books<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">[416]</a></span>
for the reference use of its staff. Such books are treatises on
engineering details, accountancy, and the Town Clerk has
usually a small collection of acts, manuals, and other literature
bearing upon municipal law. The collections are rarely if
ever large enough to possess a representative and co-ordinate
character, nor are they easily available for the whole of the staff
of the local authority or for members of the town council and
the public. There is a certain wastefulness in this method of
providing books. One or two of the greater towns have more
general municipal collections; Glasgow is an example; but
there is no town in the United Kingdom which possesses a
systematically arranged and professionally administered municipal
library, or bureau of municipal research, if the term is
preferred. Yet many things may be urged in favour of such a
department. It would be an infinite advantage to any inquirer,
whether an official or a member of the public, to be able to go
to a specially constituted department and to study what has been
the general experience of any question or scheme under consideration
or in prospect.</p>

<p>Within the limits presumed the field of the municipal reference
is a wide one. It would collect all books of an authoritative
nature on local government, and every available municipal
document, from the minutes of the local council to the small
paragraph from the newspaper which would shed light on
municipal administration. It is definitely bibliographical work
and should be placed under the control of the libraries committee;
moreover, it is expert work, and can only be conducted
satisfactorily by a man or woman who has been trained in the
collection, classification, filing, and particularly the minute
cataloguing and indexing of literary material; in short, to be
effective, it must be placed in the care of a professional librarian.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec447">447.</h4>

<p><b>447.</b> Such a library would demand fairly generous accommodation
if it is to contain the material indicated, and would require
a proper staff; it would cost money. Here, perhaps, we have the
crucial factor in the situation, because it is difficult to convince
the average municipal governor that books can bear a part in
the solution of municipal problems. It is obvious that such a
department cannot be supported out of the present resources of
library committees&mdash;in fact, it is most undesirable, even if it
is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">[417]</a></span>
legal, that the cost should fall upon the library rate. It is
special work to assist the government of a town, and should be
paid for by the governing authority as a whole and quite apart
from ordinary library funds. In Milwaukee, where the Public
Library administers such a department, the city makes an
annual appropriation of five thousand dollars from the general
city fund to be added to the library&#8217;s revenue, and used only for
municipal reference purposes. One thousand pounds a year
would possibly seem an excessive amount to the average town
council, but when it is remembered that such a library, by the
information it would afford, might save many more thousands of
pounds, the investment would seem to be an eminently satisfactory
one.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec448">448.</h4>

<p><b>448.</b> America has anticipated us in this, as in many other
library matters, and such libraries of this character as she possesses
have proved to be quite successful. A large volume
has already been devoted by Mr J. B. Kaiser to the discussion
of the practical methods in vogue in this and collateral libraries.
There, as here, stress is laid upon the economy resulting from
such work. It prevents the adoption of ill-considered municipal
schemes, or schemes which it shows to have been a failure
elsewhere. It provides examples of the successes of other towns,
and, therefore, gives the possessing town the best models upon
which to frame its own work. It is insisted, too, that this is
work for the librarian, and that it is useless to spend money upon
the provision of material and to place it in the charge of people
who are not specially equipped by education, experience, and
technical training to understand and focus the information
contained in the library. What is not so vital in America,
because of the <i>comparative</i> wealth of libraries there (few of them
are really over-financed), is the fact that while this may form an
important branch of the public library, it must have a separate
revenue.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXX<br />
<span class="title">THE COMMERCIAL DEPARTMENT</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec450">450. General.</h4>

<p><b>450. General.</b>&mdash;The most recent development of library
works which has justified itself in practice has for its aim the
provision of information useful to commercial and business men.
It is comparatively new to this country but has been in vogue
in America for some years past, in particular in the Commercial
Museum at Philadelphia, which is a separate, self-contained
institution. In Great Britain commercial libraries have been
established as part of the public library system at Glasgow,
Liverpool, Manchester, Bradford, Birmingham, Leeds and elsewhere.
The names of these towns indicate an important fact.
Separate comprehensive commercial libraries are expensive institutions,
and are only justified where a large demand for their
services may be expected. Smaller libraries may indeed have
commercial departments in connexion with their reference
departments, but it is wiser to limit their stock and work to the
definitely local trades than to attempt a general commercial
service entirely beyond their means and probable needs.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec451">451. The Commercial Department.</h4>

<p><b>451. The Commercial Department.</b>&mdash;As distinct from the
general commercial library as established in the great towns we
have named, the commercial section in an ordinary library is a
development of the Information Desk. It specializes in local
industries and trade, and on that subject collects every form of
printed and graphic material, the standard text-books and
works of reference, directories, year-books, codes, reports and
periodicals. These are classified and indexed minutely, and are
so disposed that ordinary questions which a business man may
be expected to ask can be answered as rapidly as possible. It
is what the Americans call &#8220;quick-fire reference work,&#8221; in
which immediacy of need and of its satisfaction are the prime
requisites. We do not wish to set limitations to any branch
of library service, and if a librarian can, without loss or
inconvenience<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">[419]</a></span>
in other directions, include further features from those
described in the following sections, he should certainly consider
himself at liberty to do so; but this will rarely be the case.
The separate, highly-developed commercial library is distinctly
a work for the some half-dozen British cities which are centres
of great commercial and industrial populations.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec452">452. The Commercial Library.</h4>

<p><b>452. The Commercial Library.</b>&mdash;The need has long been felt
in this country for rapid access to current and standard commercial
intelligence, although it has not always been realized,
and the need has been accentuated by the Great War, which has
made Great Britain more than ever a competitor in the world-struggle.
The Board of Trade has established an intelligence
department in London, and chambers of commerce exist in
most towns which have intelligence-work as part of their reason
for existence; but London is too far away for the provincial
man of business who wants immediate information, and the
chambers of commerce do not embrace in their membership
more than a part of the business community. Hence the desirability
of fully-equipped, skilfully-administered libraries.</p>

<p>At Glasgow, Liverpool and elsewhere the commercial library
is housed in a commodious, appropriate department as near to
the business centre of the city as possible. It is administered
by the library authority, and is in the immediate charge of a
librarian skilled in classification, filing and indexing, and the
use of works of reference. The stock of the library has been
defined by Mr S. A. Pitt, the chief librarian of Glasgow, as
standard and current; the standard consisting of treatises,
encyclop&aelig;dic works, code books, Government reports, Parliamentary
papers, and works on commercial law and business
method; the current of all kinds of fugitive papers and material
of great temporary, but probably very transient, interest, such
as notices, reports, pamphlets, leaflets, news-cuttings, catalogues
and price-lists. To the standard would be added directories of
every trade, industry and profession, and of every country,
county and important town; atlases, maps, charts and similar
material would form an important part of the collection; and,
perhaps most important of all, every financial journal, trade
periodical, etc., in English, with a liberal supply of those in other
languages. The consular reports, and other Government publications,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">[420]</a></span>
including those of the Patent Office and other technical
departments of the Crown, should be included. Some of these
can be obtained as a free grant; many of them, strange to say,
can only be obtained by purchase.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec453">453.</h4>

<p><b>453.</b> The methodology of such a library resembles that of the
ordinary reference library, with special emphasis on minute
filing and indexing. As much of the current information as
possible should be on cards or in vertical files in the most concise
form; the business man has no time to read lengthy material,
nor can he afford to wait for it while the commercial librarian
slowly produces it&mdash;that is, as a rule; there are times when a
question demands a reference to London or to some other place,
which involves delay; but in the ordinary course, a quotation,
address, character of a firm, route, code, or some such information,
is wanted, and it should be forthcoming on the instant.
The card index and vertical file, and experience in the needs of
readers, should eventually lead to effective service. Much of
the work is done by telephone, and a complete telephone equipment
is an essential of the library. The whole resources of the
general library system of the town are also at the disposal of
the user of the commercial library. The library also keeps
records of the specialities of the various manufacturers, traders,
etc., of the town, of changes in their scope, management, and
so forth; and an index of translators, typing firms and others
required at times by business people. It must revise its material
regularly and systematically so that it may always be the latest.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec454">454.</h4>

<p><b>454.</b> To secure the best results co-operation with exchanges
and chambers of commerce is desirable; and in many places
this seems to have been forthcoming. At Glasgow, Bailie A.
Campbell states that the commercial libraries, as projected by
librarians, &#8220;are to meet the wants of the smaller commercial
man, the tradesman, the man who pushes his way, the men who
have risen from nothing&#8221;; the others, presumably, are provided
for by the exchange and the chamber of commerce. At
Manchester, however, the commercial library is actually in the
Royal Exchange, and other cities have made their present progress
through the co-operation of the representative organizations
of commercial men. Unless this is forthcoming there seems
not very much chance of success. It may be that the commercial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">[421]</a></span>
library, as now initiated by librarians, will in course of time
become the nucleus of a commercial institution or bureau in which
the branches of the Board of Trade, the Chamber of Commerce,
and the various Consuls may be housed, controlled in its operations
by an expert paid a very high salary, who shall be for the
district a sort of Minister of Commerce capable of guiding the
commercial people. But that is in the region of speculation.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec455">455. Technical Libraries.</h4>

<p><b>455. Technical Libraries.</b>&mdash;While the commercial library
furnishes information for the buyer and seller of commodities,
the technical library is concerned with information for the
manufacturer and operative; the question is therefore closely
related to the question of commercial libraries, and in some
districts is the more important. In large American libraries
there is usually a separate department of the reference library
devoted to technology, but in this country the supply of such
books as this department would afford has been inadequate.
Lately considerable attention has been devoted to technical
libraries, and we may summarize a few of the results and
recommendations.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec456">456. Local Industries.</h4>

<p><b>456. Local Industries.</b>&mdash;It is clear that municipal libraries
have a special interest in providing all literature possible on
local industries; text-books of the various trades, periodicals,
patent publications, reports, catalogues and similar matter
should be collected assiduously. This does not mean that every
trade represented in the town need be treated in an exhaustive
manner, but the leading industries, by which numbers of the
townsfolk live, certainly should be. Examples of such collections
are those on engineering at Coventry, furniture at Shoreditch,
clocks and clock-making at Finsbury, coal-mining at
Wigan, and the leather trades at Northampton. Some of these,
however, are confined to books, in many cases perforce for lack
of funds and personal service; but the ideal, too often unrealized,
is a collection of material of all kinds of which books form only a
part. Local means and opportunities must determine how far
any library can carry such a collection&mdash;usually, at present, not
very far; but as many works of recognized value on the predominant
industries should certainly be stocked.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec457">457. Technical Collections Generally.</h4>

<p><b>457. Technical Collections Generally.</b>&mdash;Hitherto it has been
the province of the municipal library to supply general works<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">[422]</a></span>
in technology, and the special libraries of individual industries
have been provided by the industry. This, in the view of the
Ministry of Reconstruction&#8217;s Adult Education Committee (Third
Interim Report, <i>Libraries and Museums</i>, 1919, Cd. 9237),
should be the prevailing method of the future. It is obvious
that few public libraries can supply expensive treatises on
technical questions in which their own district is not directly interested;
even with a greatly increased library rate they could
not do so in any large measure. The greater cities may perhaps
acquire these books, but they could not supply more than one
or two copies. Too limited a view should not be taken in great
towns, because co-ordination and co-operation such as are
implied in the Joint-Technical Catalogues published at Glasgow
bring the whole resources of a wide area to a focus. In ordinary
towns the present aim should be to obtain the largest possible
number of general and special works in science and applied
science, and to leave the supply of the more expensive, recondite,
and valuable but rarely used treatises to a central reservoir
library, which may be developed out of the Central Lending
Library for Students, perhaps with the aid of the special libraries
of the various institutions which represent trades and professions.
The main aim of the Library Association is to have a
central reservoir library established in London from which all
libraries may draw important little-used books; and the Ministry
of Reconstruction&#8217;s Committee adopt this idea as the basis of
their scheme for the co-ordination and re-organization of libraries.</p>

<p>In building up technical collections a library benefits greatly
by expert assistance; but the advice of several, and not one
only, is very desirable, since experts rarely agree on minute
questions of books, and each of any two experts cancels the
idiosyncrasies of the other. But experts can usually be found
from neighbouring universities, or big industrial concerns, who
will give the library the benefit of their knowledge, especially in
assessing the value of older books. No section of the library
needs revision so frequently as the technical, unless it be the
commercial. This is more especially likely to be the case in
these next few years after the War, when all industrial advances
made from 1914 onwards will probably be recorded, to the
superseding of many previous books.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXI<br />
<span class="title">READING-ROOM METHODS</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec460">460. Newsrooms.</h4>

<p><b>460. Newsrooms.</b>&mdash;The chief difference which exists in the
composition of British and American libraries is the frequent
absence from the latter of general reading rooms in which the
principal newspapers are displayed for public use. The newsroom
has never been generally recognized in the United States
as a necessary department of a public library, and, save in a few
exceptional cases, these rooms are not to be found in the average
American public library. The nearest approach to the British
newsroom in America is the large magazine reading room, in
which all kinds of weekly and monthly periodicals are displayed.
This is substantially the same as a newsroom, but without the
current numbers of daily newspapers. There are reasons why
the Americans do not encourage newsrooms, and one is the
enormous number of newspapers which exist in every large town.
The display of a representative selection of newspapers and the
cost of maintaining the department would occupy a large space,
and the funds would be spent to a considerable extent in providing
one of the least healthy forms of literature. But perhaps
the real reason for the American indifference to the newsroom
is the sensational and vulgar tone of a considerable portion
of the newspaper press. Some American newspapers are free
from such undesirable and objectionable features as sensational
and untrue comments on current events, vulgar personalities,
exaggeration and misrepresentation, objectionable and dangerous
advertisements, and a very low level of literary merit, but
many are not. The best fugitive work of American writers of
any importance is to be found in the magazines and literary
weeklies, which offer a marked contrast in every respect, save
perhaps as regards advertisements, to the somewhat debased
character of many American daily newspapers. These are all
reasons why newsrooms on the British plan are not quite desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_425" id="Page_425">[425]</a></span>
in American libraries, and they apply to a large extent to
the altered conditions of recent British journalism. Time was
when the average British newspaper represented a high standard
of accuracy, fairness and literary ability, but since the importation
of many doubtful American methods, the character of
the press has to a large measure degenerated. Moreover, few
British newspapers are independent of political or corporation
control, although exceptions exist, and impartial reports of and
comments upon news are rare.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec461">461.</h4>

<p><b>461.</b> The stock arguments in favour of newspapers are reasonable,
and have a strong element of truth in them. They attract
a class of reader who would not otherwise come to the library at
all, and satisfy the literary aspirations of some ratepayers who
might receive otherwise no direct return for their rates. The
presence of literary, technical and commercial periodicals in the
newsroom is also said to attract a large number of interested
readers, and no doubt it does; but this result might be achieved
independently of the newspaper element. Newspaper readers
are often a class apart; they rarely read anything else. <i>Real</i>
newspaper readers are comparatively few, and besides those who
come for the weekly periodicals, the newsroom attracts loafers,
sporting men and all kinds of hopeless individuals, to whom the
comparative comfort of the newsroom is an attraction. Mr
George Gissing, in one of his sketches, has drawn an exaggerated
picture of such a newsroom haunter, who suffers from a kind of
neurosis which drags him irresistibly to a public newsroom,
there to indulge his morbid olfactory sense. The main argument
in favour of newsrooms is that they present representative
journals of every shade of opinion, and give the opportunity
which is badly needed of comparative reading. But it is a
department which some librarians think costs rather more than
is justified by its actual value. When the annual charges for
periodicals, fittings, lighting, heating, oversight and proportion
of loan are all added together, it will be found that a newsroom
costs a very considerable amount, which could be applied to
more permanent advantage in a reference or lending library.
The smaller the library the greater is the proportionate cost, and
committees may seriously consider the question of limitation in
public newsrooms, at any rate so far as daily newspapers are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_426" id="Page_426">[426]</a></span>
concerned. It is clearly a department where continual supervision
is necessary, where it is most difficult to enforce discipline,
and one that gives rise to continual public criticism.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec462">462.</h4>

<p><b>462.</b> A few years ago the practice of <i>blacking out</i> the betting
news was adopted in some newsrooms, as an experimental device
to discourage the sporting element, which in some towns used
to obstruct the greater part of the newsrooms. This is mentioned,
not as an example to be followed, but as showing the
shifts some library authorities have been driven to in order to
prevent abuses. This practice of obliteration is now rare.
Another suggestion for coping with the betting fraternity is
to cease buying or displaying the evening papers, or to procure
them so late as to make them useless for the purposes of the
sporting element, while not in any way penalizing the reader
who comes after 7 p.m. As a further suggestion for limiting
the cost and obstructions of most newsrooms in large towns, it
has been proposed (1) that only the morning daily papers be
bought, for the benefit of the unemployed; (2) that the &#8220;Situations
Vacant&#8221; columns only be displayed from 7 or 8 till 11 a.m.;
(3) that the whole of them be removed at 11 o&#8217;clock, and their
places occupied by maps, charts, pictures of current topics, or
other similar broadside matter likely to interest and instruct.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec463">463.</h4>

<p><b>463.</b> In this way a newsroom might be greatly improved, and
the character of its work changed, without interfering with the
use of the illustrated periodicals, technical journals and trade
papers displayed on the tables. By utilizing the wall space
only for newspapers, good oversight is obtained and a certain
amount of limitation is forced upon the authority by mechanical
means. In arranging newspapers on the stands, care should be
taken to separate the popular journals by a few less popular ones,
so as to avoid continuous crowding at one or two points. The
people who read newspapers should be distributed round the
walls as thinly as possible, and this can only be effected by
spreading the papers all round the available area.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec464">464.</h4>

<p><b>464.</b> In selecting newspapers for a newsroom great care should
be taken to represent all political parties, and at the same time
to avoid as far as may be the sensational element. All local
papers should be taken, if not for display at least for permanent
preservation. The leading London and provincial dailies should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_427" id="Page_427">[427]</a></span>
be taken, and a representative daily from Scotland and Ireland,
and the leading foreign newspapers in French and German at least.</p>

<div class="figc300" id="Fig165">
<img src="images/illo444.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="530" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 165.</span>&mdash;Double Newspaper Stand, Chelsea (<a href="#Sec466">Section 466</a>).</p>
</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec465">465.</h4>

<p><b>465.</b> Newspapers are best displayed upon wall stands where
possible, as more oversight can be obtained, and the economy
over standard slopes, with papers on both sides, is undeniable.
A newsroom fitted with newspaper stands at right angles to the
walls, and covering most of the floor space, presents a somewhat
crowded and obstructed appearance, and it is impossible for the
staff to thoroughly overlook it easily. Apart from this a newsroom
gains much in appearance, spaciousness and airiness when the
newspapers are relegated to the walls, well out of the way. The
weekly journals can be kept very conveniently on tables, as shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">[428]</a></span>
in <a href="#Sec162">Sections 162</a>-<a href="#Sec165">65</a>, and it is sometimes found advantageous to secure
them by means of cords or chains as described in <a href="#Sec163">Section 163</a>.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec466">466. Newspaper Stands.</h4>

<p><b>466. Newspaper Stands.</b>&mdash;The present conditions of printing
and production seem to make the broadside style of newspaper
a necessity in all countries, and till some radical change in
machinery is introduced which will permit newspapers in
pamphlet or small quarto form to be produced rapidly, large
stands for the display of newspapers will have to be provided.
Standard newspaper slopes either at right angles to walls or
distributed over the floor of a newsroom are not recommended,
for the reasons already given and because their cost is much
greater. They are necessary, however, in some cases, owing to
considerations of light and convenience, and the form and
dimensions indicated will be found useful (<a href="#Fig165">Figs. 165</a> and <a href="#Fig166">166</a>).</p>

</div>

</div><!--figc450-->

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec467">467.</h4>

<p><b>467.</b> Apart from the fact that an exclusive use of wall
slopes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">[429]</a></span>
leaves the centre of the room free, it permits the titles and whereabouts
of newspapers to be more easily noticed. Wall slopes
should be made to the same dimensions as standards, save, of
course, that only one face is necessary. The lower part of the
slope should project eighteen inches to fifteen inches from the
wall, to give a convenient angle for reading. Too great a slope
is not desirable, as it tends to throw the top of the paper out of
the reach and eye range of short people. This difficulty has
been met most satisfactorily by the system designed, we believe,
by Mr E. A. Savage for use at Wallasey. Here the slopes work
on a central pivot and move backwards and forwards to enable
the top or bottom of the paper to be read with ease, and are
so balanced that they fall easily and readily into their correct
position when released. These slopes, it may be added, are much
lower than those usually adopted, and a reader may be seated at
them and may compass the whole paper thus. A small beading
or projection at the foot of the slope is frequently of use in preventing
papers from drooping.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec468">468. Newspaper Fittings.</h4>

<p><b>468. Newspaper Fittings.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Titles</span> for newspapers should be
fixed on the stands over the centre of the spaces occupied by the
papers. A title-board about six inches high should be provided
for the purpose. It can be made to slide along a projection on
the top of the stands if grooved on its under side. On this the
name-tablets of the newspapers should appear in bold letters,
not less than two inches high. These tablets may be printed
on paper or card, or may appear on enamelled, metal or plate-glass
tablets. There is a very large variety of such name-tablets
on the market, and choice will not be difficult. It is a useful
practice to attach to the fronts of the stands at intervals small
bone, metal or card tablets intimating that papers must be
surrendered to other readers after a certain period of warning
has elapsed. A useful form of such intimation is as follows:</p>

<div class="sign2">

<p class="fsize125 sstype noindent"><b>Readers are requested to relinquish
newspapers within TEN MINUTES of
being asked to do so by other readers.</b></p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec469">469.</h4>

<p><b>469.</b> <span class="smcap">Holders.</span>&mdash;There is a very large variety of rods, clips,
and other means for holding newspapers on their stands, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">[430]</a></span>
the following illustrations will describe them better than words.
A good form is used in the public libraries of Hammersmith,
Wolverhampton, Leicester, Finsbury, Liverpool, etc., and consists
of a pair of screw clips which can be readily adjusted to
any height of paper. These Simplex clips are illustrated on the
revolving rod. <a href="#Fig168">Fig. 168</a> is called the &#8220;Simplex&#8221; newspaper
rod, and is fastened to the bottom by means of a screw turned
by a key. It is used in the public libraries of Wolverhampton,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">[431]</a></span>
Croydon, Hull, West Ham, Glasgow, etc. <a href="#Fig169">Fig. 169</a> is a revolving
holder which can be adjusted to different sizes of illustrated
periodicals, by means of the sliding screw clips. It is intended
for periodicals like the <i>Graphic</i>, <i>Sketch</i>, <i>Architect</i>, etc., which
frequently have large folding plates running across two pages,
and which cannot be conveniently examined when the journal
is secured to a stand. A special form of separate wooden stand
or easel is also made for such illustrated journals, which will be
found useful when room is scarce on the other slopes.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec470">470.</h4>

<p><b>470.</b> Other fittings for newspaper slopes which are sometimes
used are metal leaning bars or fences to keep readers from leaning
on the papers and tearing them. These must be very strongly
fastened at the foot of the slope in such a position as to project about
four to six inches from the front. They should be held in strong
brackets, as they have to support a very considerable weight.</p>

<p>The sticks and rods for holding single or several newspapers, such
as are used for clubs and restaurants, are not particularly suitable
for public library use, unless under very exceptional circumstances.</p>

<p>One of the commonest abuses of the newsroom is the tearing
or cutting out of parts of newspapers (ladies frequently remove
them with the scratching of the point of a hat-pin!), especially
of advertisements. It is well to have a notice prominently displayed
to the effect that this is a penal offence, and that persons
desiring to copy advertisements may borrow pencil and paper
for the purpose on application.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec471">471. Magazine Rooms and Periodicals.</h4>

<p><b>471. Magazine Rooms and Periodicals.</b>&mdash;The newsroom may
be made the store for all the trade, technical and other weeklies
which in any way convey <i>news</i> in their own particular fields;
while the magazine room, if provided separately, may be reserved
for the monthly and quarterly magazines, reviews and other miscellanies,
which are not so much vehicles for the spread of current
news. This is a rough division, but it seems a reasonable one
for libraries where some distinction must be made between newsrooms
and magazine rooms. In the selection of periodicals and
magazines the same care should be taken as with newspapers to
choose only the best and most representative. Committees
should make it an invariable rule never to take any sectarian
paper, save as a donation, or in response to a widespread public
demand. Church and chapel papers are often forced upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">[432]</a></span>
libraries by their respective partisans out of sheer rivalry, and
when this sort of thing once begins the library is sure to suffer
by having to pay dearly for the gratification of mere sectarian
feeling. It is waste of money to subscribe for the papers of this,
that, and the other sect, on the sentimental grounds of fair play
all round, and of meeting the views of large bodies of ratepayers
in the same spirit as the wishes of trades or professions are met
by providing technical and other journals. But there is this
difference. A technical journal appeals to all sects, while a
sectarian journal does not, and, as a matter of fact, is seldom
read by its adherents once the honour of the faith is vindicated
by having it placed in the public library. Some libraries adopt
the rule of refusing all donations of periodicals in order to prevent
the difficulties that arise.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec472">472.</h4>

<p><b>472.</b> The arrangement of periodicals and magazines in their
respective rooms calls for some notice. There are several ways
in actual use which all prove satisfactory, and which are, nevertheless,
very different in application. The most common plan
of displaying periodicals is to spread them loose all over the
tables in strong covers lettered with the titles, and to try to
maintain a rough alphabetical order. Another method is to
place the periodicals in their covers in racks as described
in <a href="#Sec162">Sections 162</a>-<a href="#Sec165">65</a>. The readers are expected to take what
periodical they want from these racks, read it at the tables,
and return it to its place in the rack. As a rule they either do
not return them accurately or they leave them lying on the
tables. But in any case this method is preferable to the plan
of spreading them over the tables, as it acts in a measure as an
indicator to the periodicals in use. A third method is to keep
the whole of the periodicals off the tables or racks, and to issue
them from a counter or rack which is superintended by an
assistant. This can be done in a number of ways, but preferably
by means of an indicator such as is described in <a href="#Sec393">Section 393</a>.
The last plan is one which has the advantage of providing each
periodical with a fixed place where it can always be found,
though it entails the provision of a separate chair and table
space for every magazine, and so requires a much greater amount
of space than any of the other methods.</p>

<div class="figc450" id="Fig170">
<img src="images/illo450.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="558" />
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 170.</span>&mdash;Adjustable Periodicals List (<a href="#Sec474">Section 474</a>).</p>
</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec473">473.</h4>

<p><b>473.</b> With tables provided with racks in the manners shown<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">[433]</a></span>
in <a href="#Sec165">Section 165</a> the periodicals can be arranged alphabetically,
or classified by kind, and secured to the rack or table by means
of stout cords or chains covered with leather to prevent noise.
If double-sided tables are available, with divisions as described
above, they should be provided. Double-sided tables, especially
if narrow, are not comfortable to sit at, either on account of the
knees, breath or manners of your <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>, but when divided
by means of a central partition, much of this objection is removed.
Except for the difficulty of providing space for every separate
periodical, it has been found, after trial of most of the other
methods, that the fixed plan, plus some convenient means of
inserting a new periodical at any point, is on the whole the most
satisfactory all round. It is a decided advantage for a reader<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_434" id="Page_434">[434]</a></span>
to be able to go straight to the place where the magazine he
wants is fixed, and to find it always there when directed to it
from any form of indicator or periodicals list. If the less popular
or valuable periodicals were placed in a rack similar to that
shown in <a href="#Sec165">Section 165</a>, <a href="#Fig49">Fig. 49</a>, the space required for displaying
the better periodicals and magazines would be considerably
restricted in area, while there would be a gain in space as well.
The plan of keeping all the periodicals together which deal with
the same trade or subject is very advantageous, and has the effect
of removing the readers of lighter magazines, who are sometimes
of a restless type, from the more studious reader who wants quiet.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec474">474.</h4>

<p><b>474.</b> In any plan of displaying periodicals on tables or racks
a key to the order should be provided in the shape of an adjustable
periodical list, which gives a complete list of every periodical
or magazine contained in a room. It is an appliance in which
the name of every periodical taken by the library is clearly displayed
on a printed movable slip in a glazed English oak frame.
This frame has a movable back to which are attached xylonite
strips which retain the printed titles of the magazines in place,
enabling them to be arranged in any order and to be added to or
taken from at pleasure. Thus the name of a withdrawn or defunct
periodical can be easily removed and that of a new one added.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec475">475.</h4>

<p><b>475.</b> The checking of periodicals and newspapers as received,
and every morning as they lie on the tables, should be done by
means of special records or checks. An effective form of check
card for magazines or periodicals as received from the newsagent
is shown in <a href="#Fig171">Figs. 171</a>-<a href="#Fig173">3</a>. This shows overdues at once, and
enables a complete check to be kept on the delivery of periodicals.
One kind of ruling suffices for every kind of periodical, daily,
weekly, monthly or quarterly, and the cards are ruled as in the
figures below with heading and fifty-two lines to the page. If
necessary both sides can be ruled, and so one card can be made
to last for a long time.</p>

<p>In the cards for monthly periodicals the names of the months
should be written in advance, the dates of receipt being added
against each month as the magazine is received. In the case of
weeklies and dailies the numbers are to be entered number by
number as received. An overdue can be noticed at once by
anyone going over the cards, by simply noting that a weekly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">[435]</a></span>
due on Friday, the day previous to the actual date of publication,
has not been entered. These cards should be examined for
overdues daily in the case of dailies, and every Friday evening or
Saturday morning in the case of weeklies and monthlies. If
each kind is stored in a suitable box or portfolio the checking
and marking-off can be done with great rapidity. These cards
can also be used for annuals, society publications, etc. In the
latter case the year can be written at the top of the column, and
the publications received for the subscription can be written
in the column lengthways. If nothing has been received by
the middle of any year, the society can be notified. But the
irregularity of society and other subscription publications is a
feature which requires a good deal of watching, and a card
check of some kind is essential.</p>

order of all the periodicals as they are arranged on stands, tables
or racks. Anything missing should be noted on a separate slip
of paper, and entered in the work-book. The initials of the
checker should also be written in the work-book in the space
provided. (See <a href="#Sec89">Section 89</a>.) The librarian should receive the
check slip if anything is missing. In similar fashion the assistant
who examines the periodical check cards for overdues should
notify the librarian of any numbers not promptly received.</p>

<p>The filing of magazines and newspapers may be done in a
variety of ways. Newspapers should be kept in order on special
racks, in piles, with a suitable board underneath to act as a
runner and support, and a sheet of cardboard or glazed casing
paper above to prevent the settling of dust. Periodicals and
magazines may either be kept in special cloth-covered boxes
made to take a whole or half-year&#8217;s numbers, as the case may
be, or kept on boards in the same manner as newspapers. In
both cases alphabetical order of titles will be found a suitable
arrangement. The plan of placing the numbers of a periodical
as done at the Mitchell Library, Glasgow, seems a simple and
effective manner of dealing with a large number of files. This
is illustrated in <a href="#Fig174">Fig. 174</a>.</p>

All other methods of occasional counts and the striking

so strong, unfortunately, that librarians are driven to
satisfy their committees as to the use made of reading rooms,
and in the absence of a turnstile the best thing to do is to take
whole-day counts as follows: on a Monday in January; Tuesday
in February; Wednesday in March, etc.; divide the total by
twelve, and multiply the average thus obtained by the number
of days open. Every individual who enters or re-enters must
be counted. This gives a mere approximation to the actual
attendance, but is a better and more reasonable plan than
counting the readers present in the rooms every hour or half-hour,
adding the totals together, and reckoning the result as the
day&#8217;s attendance.</p>

plan to frame a few copies of the 1898 &#8220;Act to provide for the

places, along with the admonitory notices regarding

<p><b>479. Women&#8217;s Rooms.</b>&mdash;About eighty public libraries in
Britain have provided separate rooms for the use of women, but
it is doubtful if such accommodation is really necessary, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_438" id="Page_438">[438]</a></span>
they have not been uniformly successful. To a certain extent
the matter depends upon the locality. If there is plenty of room
in the building there is no harm in making this extra provision,
if the room can be properly overlooked, but in cases where space
is limited, it is a mistake to cramp the rest of the building for the
sake of a somewhat sentimental idea. A few extra women of a
fidgety or timid sort may be attracted to the library because of
this exclusive accommodation, but the great majority of women
prefer to use the ordinary departments of a public library on
the same footing and conditions as men, and resent distinctions,
such as the room implies. If women can use the crowded spaces
in front of restricted lending libraries, and can mix with men in
open lending libraries, they can surely use the other public
rooms without harm or inconvenience.</p>

<p><b>480. Public Lavatory Accommodation.</b>&mdash;This is perhaps a
convenient place to mention lavatory accommodation for the
public. It should not be provided by public library authorities
at all, unless to a limited extent for the use of reference library
readers, or for social meetings in connexion with lecture rooms.
It is the duty of the sanitary or public health authorities to provide
this kind of public accommodation, and not library boards
with painfully limited funds. Somewhere adjacent to the library
building provision of this kind can be made by the local authority,
and it will be found a convenience to the public and a relief to
the library funds.</p>

<h2>DIVISION XIII<br />
LIBRARY WORK WITH CHILDREN</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXII<br />
<span class="title">THE CHILDREN&#8217;S DEPARTMENT</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec482">482. General Considerations.</h4>

<p><b>482. General Considerations.</b>&mdash;The declaration of the Library
Association that library work with children is the foundation
of all other library work represents, so far as Great Britain is
concerned, an ideal rather than an accomplished fact. The will
to make provision for the child has not been lacking, but the
means at the disposal of library committees have hitherto been
insufficient for other activities, and the child has necessarily
been dealt with in a parsimonious manner. Undoubtedly, in
circumstances hitherto prevailing, the axiom that to pursue
work for children at the expense of the efficiency of the library
as a whole is to defeat its very purpose, is true. But from
comparatively early times the book needs of the children have
been recognized. So long ago as 1882 Nottingham possessed a
reading room for children, and, with intervals, such departments
have been multiplied, and there is now hardly a town of any size
which does not make <i>some</i> provision for young readers. The
object of the children&#8217;s department is to provide the intellectual
workshop for the use of the child. He is taught to use intellectual
tools in the school, but the library provides him with
the material upon which they may be exercised. Usually the
department serves children from the age of six to the age of
fourteen. In a completely organized department there are
library, reading department, and study corners; and such
activities as story hours, lectures, reading circles, and the
keeping of festivals are maintained.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec483">483. What has been Done.</h4>

<p><b>483. What has been Done.</b>&mdash;Separate, distinctive children&#8217;s
departments are a quite modern institution. Hitherto, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_440" id="Page_440">[440]</a></span>
majority of libraries, an alcove, or a number of shelves, have
been set aside for children&#8217;s books in the adult lending department,
and no provision has definitely, been made for newspapers,
magazines and other reading material for the young. Many
difficulties have arisen from this arrangement. The age of
admission to libraries is usually fourteen, and children under
this age, except in special circumstances, have been limited to
books in the shelves allocated to children. But children of
eleven or twelve frequently require books which cannot by any
ordinary reasoning be regarded as juvenile works; and on every
such occasion special concessions have been made, the requiring
and the granting of which are irritating both to the child and
the librarian, however liberal-minded the latter may be, and
therefore subversive of the best results. More recently the age
of fourteen has been regarded as too high, and in some towns
twelve, or even ten, years has been regarded as a suitable age at
which children may be given the freedom of the whole lending
department. This seems better, and where such low age limits
have been set the results have been good. It is obvious, however,
that the limited provision we have described in this section
is not calculated to prove the &#8220;foundation of all library work.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec484">484. Children&#8217;s Libraries.</h4>

<p><b>484. Children&#8217;s Libraries.</b>&mdash;From these considerations has
developed the modern children&#8217;s department as an entirely
separate part of the library, equivalent in rank and importance
to the adult lending or reference departments. In England the
most elaborate system of such libraries is that at Cardiff, but
many other towns, including Glasgow, Liverpool, Manchester,
Leeds, Islington, Chelsea, Hampstead, Coventry, St Helens, and
Nottingham, have such separate departments, and every modern
librarian in planning a library system provides for them. The
limits of this <i>Manual</i> do not permit of an exhaustive study of
the many varieties of children&#8217;s libraries and their manifold
activities, but an outline of the methods most commonly in
vogue here and in America (where the work is far more highly
developed than here) are an integral part of our work.</p>

<p>The children&#8217;s department, then, should be an apartment
as effective in architectural character as any other department:
well-lighted, spacious, lofty, and decorated tastefully. These
factors are overlooked at times, sometimes, unfortunately, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_441" id="Page_441">[441]</a></span>
necessity; but we insist upon them, because the atmosphere
induced by a handsome and suitable library is necessary if we
are, first, to avoid ruffling the sensitiveness of children who are
as jealous of their rights in the public libraries as are adults;
and, second, to create that feeling of reverence and respect for
books which is a factor in obtaining discipline in the apartment.
An ill-lighted, crudely-decorated basement is sometimes devoted
to the purpose, and this may have its uses, but it is certain to
fall short lamentably of the full possibilities of a children&#8217;s
library. The apartment being provided, several problems have
to be settled. The systems in existence differ in different places.
In some towns the children&#8217;s department is a reading room and
reference library merely, and books are not lent for home reading.
It is thought, in such cases, that the children can best be
provided with books for home reading through a system of
school libraries, such as we describe in the next chapter. This,
however, seems to ignore the fact that such school libraries are
usually restricted to public and council schools, that there are
other kinds of schools in every town, and large numbers of children,
therefore, who have not access to school libraries; and their
claims to library facilities are as strong as those of public and
council school children. Such is the system in vogue, we believe,
at Cardiff. In other towns the department embraces lending
library, reading room, and reference library, and good examples
of these are to be seen at Islington. Here the room is divided
into two parts, the smaller part being an open access lending
library, and the greater part a reading room, with special tables
set apart for quiet study, and containing a carefully-chosen
collection of reference books. These methods have both great
advantages, and are worthy of rather more detailed consideration.</p>

</div>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec485">485. The Reference-Reading Method.</h4>

<p><b>485. The Reference-Reading Method.</b>&mdash;We have used this
name for want of a better to indicate the system which limits
the use of the contents of the room to the room itself&mdash;-a system,
we may add, which has been approved by the Conference of
Librarians held at Manchester in 1918, as the better of the two
described. The library is usually a large room with wall-cases
for books upon two or three sides of the room, but with one wall
left blank and whitened for use as a lantern screen, and intervals
of the walls covered with baize screens upon which pictures,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">[442]</a></span>
bulletins, lists, etc., can be displayed. Part of the room is
reserved for children who desire to do home lessons, or make
special study, or who wish (as is more frequently the case than
is generally supposed) to become authors. For these, small
desks, separate if possible, are provided, and the use of ink is
permitted. Another set of tables is allocated to such newspapers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_443" id="Page_443">[443]</a></span>
and periodicals as are suitable for children. The selection of
the latter is a matter requiring special care. Good daily newspapers
may be provided&mdash;<i>The Daily Graphic</i>, for instance, is
interesting to most children&mdash;but there is a real need for a
definitely children&#8217;s <i>newspaper</i>, one that presents in a manner
attractive to the child mind a selection of the matter occurring
in the ordinary newspaper; the recognized children&#8217;s periodicals
in English and French, and in other languages where circumstances
warrant it; such &#8220;instructive&#8221; periodicals as those
teaching shorthand, languages, how to make things, and simple
&#8220;trade&#8221; periodicals; as well as a selection of such weekly
journals as <i>The Illustrated London News</i> and <i>The Graphic</i>.
Children are more virile mentally than is sometimes supposed,
and many ostensibly adult periodicals are quite suitable for them.
The remainder of the room may be devoted to tables or desks
for the reading of the books from the cases.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec486">486. Lending Library.</h4>

<p><b>486. Lending Library.</b>&mdash;All the features enumerated in the
foregoing section should be found in the department which has
also a lending library, except that the number of books to be
provided for reading in the room will probably be smaller, and
fewer book-cases will in that case be necessary. The lending
section will be conducted on principles similar to those governing
the adult lending library, with such adaptations as experience
suggests to be desirable. Simplicity is the keynote of the work,
and the regulations governing the issue of readers&#8217; tickets and
the lending of books should be made as easy and unambiguous
as possible. A few of these may be mentioned:</p>

<p class="hind2_4 blankabove">1. Children should be permitted to borrow books upon the
recommendation of the head teacher of the school they
attend. In some libraries a more definite guarantee is
required to prevent possible loss and to recover the cost
of loss or damages, as it is obvious that the teacher cannot
be expected to accept financial responsibility in this connexion
and would undoubtedly refuse to do so; and these
require the children to be guaranteed by burgesses in the
same manner as adult readers. It will be found, however,
that children have frequently some difficulty in finding a
guarantor; even parents at times refuse to bind themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">[444]</a></span>
in this way; and, with careful supervision, the
teacher&#8217;s recommendation will be found to be effective.
A good form of application is as follows:</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 176.</span>&mdash;Voucher for Children (<a href="#Sec486">Section 486</a>).<br />
The back is the ordinary
guarantee, as <a href="#Fig135">Fig. 135</a>.</p>

<p class="hind2_4 blankbefore">2. Children should be permitted to borrow books on the
application of the head of their household. In this
case the householder may be expected to assume the
responsibilities of any ordinary guarantor.</p>

<p class="hind2_4">3. In ordinary circumstances a child should be permitted to
borrow one book only at a time, and should not be permitted
to change it for another more frequently than
once a week.</p>

<p class="hind2_3">We desire to avoid controversial matter in this <i>Manual</i>,
and this provision, we expect, is open to criticism;
indeed, when it was suggested elsewhere an American
librarian remarked that it &#8220;seemed unnecessary.&#8221; British
librarians, however, have actually been requested by
teachers to make these restrictions on the arguments
that few children do any comparative reading, and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_445" id="Page_445">[445]</a></span>
still fewer can read more than one book in a week and at
the same time do their home lessons and spend as much
time in outdoor recreation as is needful for their health.
Another less satisfactory reason is that some librarians
have found the child population, when not so restricted,
crowding the lending library to such an extent that their
staffs have been unable to maintain the discipline without
which effective work is impossible, or to meet the
demands of the children. Such librarians have divided
their register of children alphabetically, and children
whose names begin with certain letters are admitted to
the lending library only on certain days.</p>

<p class="hind2_4">4. The rules should embody simple provisions governing the
duration of loan (usually fourteen days are allowed, but
circumstances may warrant an extension of this time),
cleanliness, care of books, and the disposal of books in
cases where the child or any member of the household is
in contact with infection.</p>

<p class="blankbefore">A difficult matter is what, if any, penalties should be inflicted
upon children in the case of undue detention of books or for other
offences. Fines are sometimes imposed, as in the adult library,
but often they cannot be recovered without great trouble, and
they should usually be remitted when any reasonable excuse can
be offered. Many children cannot obtain the necessary pence,
except from their parents, and to press for fines frequently means
that the child will be forbidden the use of the library by the
parents. In this matter the librarian should have the fullest
discretion. Persistent offenders are effectively dealt with by
the suspending of their tickets for a time; but we do not wish to
insist upon this method, as the librarian naturally desires to have
books used rather than to prevent their use. Lost books must
be replaced by parents as a matter of course whenever it is
possible to get at them; and the teacher will often lend his
powerful assistance in securing the return or replacing of missing
volumes, and, indeed, in seeing that the library rules generally
are observed by his pupils. Co-operation and sympathy between
librarian and teacher are first essentials of successful work.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec487">487. Furniture and Fittings.</h4>

<p><b>487. Furniture and Fittings.</b>&mdash;The furnishing of the
children&#8217;s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">[446]</a></span>
room is governed by the considerations explained in <a href="#Page_132">Division V.</a>,
but again with adaptations dictated by the fact that the furniture
is for children and not for adults. Desks, tables, chairs,
reading slopes, etc., should be of such heights that they can be
used with comfort. In regard to tables and chairs, 25<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches is
a suitable height for the former and 14<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>4</sub> inches for the latter.
Book-cases should be approximately 6<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> feet in height as against
7 feet for adults. Such rigid furnishing as that which provides
long narrow desks resembling school forms for the children, so
arranged that the children all face one way, is to be deprecated.
Tables which provide the maximum of space, comfort and
seclusion are as desirable for this room as for any other. Each
periodical and reader requires three feet of lateral space, and
there should be three feet between each table, or four where
the space is a gangway. Screens of some soft wood, covered
with baize, should be placed on the walls, at intervals; and a
blackboard and an optical lantern are valuable parts of the
equipment. Any space that may remain on the walls may be
devoted to pictures, which need not be many, but should be
large, deal with definite subjects, and be good of their kind.
These are the more obvious differences between the children&#8217;s and
the adult departments, except that in some libraries lavatory
accommodation is provided in order that children may wash
their hands before entering the library proper. Such accommodation
has distinct advantages, as many children come into
the department straight from playing in the street, and it is rather
hard to refuse them admission because their hands are not in a
suitable state for the using of books. On the other hand, strict
supervision of such accommodation is necessary, and this is
difficult to provide on account of the increased cost involved.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec488">488. Book Selection.</h4>

<p><b>488. Book Selection.</b>&mdash;A few principles governing the selection
of books for children may be given here, drawn from an
immense mass of written material upon the subject. In a
general way it may be asserted that the child is the best judge
of its own literature, and the classics for children survive as
such simply because they receive the continued suffrages of
children. Excellent bibliographies and lists exist, especially
American ones, and many libraries have issued catalogues of
their children&#8217;s libraries. A comparison of these is a
necessary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">[447]</a></span>
preliminary to stocking the department. Catholicity and a
not too rigid insistence upon high literary merit are proper
attitudes, because there is no exact definition of a children&#8217;s
book, and any book likely to be used by children should be
regarded as suitable; and the variations in taste and capability
of children are so great that if there is too pronounced insistence
upon high literary quality many children will neglect the books
provided. It is better to commence with a lower average of
merit and attract children, and then, by placing better books in
their way, to improve their tastes without too much obtruding of
the fact upon them. By this it is not meant that worthless books
are to be included, but there are undoubtedly books having no
claim to high rank which are wholesome and harmless. A preponderating
part of the lending stock will be of fiction&mdash;perhaps
twenty per cent. of it&mdash;and here the librarian has the accumulated
experience of other librarians to assist his selection, and, with
regard to contemporary writings, they are not so numerous that
the characteristics of any given author cannot easily be tested.
Books of classic rank should be available in such numbers that
there are always enough copies to meet the current demand and
at the same time to leave a copy on the shelves. A librarian
should never be compelled to reply to a child that <i>Ivanhoe</i>, <i>The
Last of the Mohicans</i>, <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>, <i>Robinson Crusoe</i>,
or <i>The Jungle Book</i>, for example, is &#8220;out.&#8221; It is questionable
whether abridged or adapted versions or extracts from classics
should be stocked; they often give children an entirely false
impression of the work they represent, and as a general rule
works that may be &#8220;extracted&#8221; for children should be provided
in their original form. A &#8220;Bowdlerized&#8221; Shakespeare is an
objectionable work; the more virile or doubtful parts of the
complete plays rarely touch children or are understood by them.
In other classes of literature great discretion must be exercised.
A balanced selection covering the whole field of knowledge should
be the aim, and although there are still many blank spaces in
this field, there are fortunately thousands of works on the arts,
sciences, history, biography, and, indeed, upon most subjects,
eminently adapted to children. Mere simplicity is not the first
essential of such books. Children of quite tender years can make
use of many books which are not intended primarily for them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">[448]</a></span>
and these may frequently be admitted with great advantage.
The intrinsic side of selection may be summarized briefly:
Admit all books which appeal to children so long as they are in
good English, have no immoral tendency, do not bring the
sanctities of life into ridicule, are accurate, and have a worthy
quality of humour. This last condition is important. The
average child has not a very refined sense of humour, he prefers
it of a concrete quality, without irony or sarcasm, and too
often founded upon human depravity, deformity and misfortune;
this taste must be counteracted.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec489">489.</h4>

<p><b>489.</b> The physical side of books is only less important than
the literary, a fact frequently overlooked. Good, legible, well-inked
type, good paper, well-drawn, coloured and accurately-registered
illustrations should always be sought. There is an
&aelig;sthetic value in books which should not be neglected, and this
is absent from ill-produced works; and the eyesight of children
should be guarded from small or illegible print. Bindings should
be strong and durable, an almost impossible condition at the
present day when cheap machine-made cases are the rule. The
life of the book of to-day in continual use is at best only a few
months. Before the European War publishers were gradually
introducing reinforced and other strong bindings for children&#8217;s
books, and it is to be hoped that this desirable practice will in
due course be resumed.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec490">490.</h4>

<p><b>490.</b> Recent events have so affected the book-market that
any rigid estimate of the average cost of books would be futile,
as being subject to probable immense fluctuations. Five years
ago 3s. 6d. was a fair average price for a lending library book
for young readers; at the time of writing 5s. would be nearer
the sum that would have to be paid. It can only be assumed
that a considerable time will elapse before books will return
to their original prices. Any other assumption would be unwise.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec491">491. Administration.</h4>

<p><b>491. Administration.</b>&mdash;Primary factors in successful work are
freedom of access, the maintenance of proper but not oppressive
discipline, and the administration of the department by a
specially trained and qualified staff. Ruskin&#8217;s theory that a child
should be let loose in a good library to choose or reject as he wills
has proved to be satisfactory in practice, and to promote that
sense of personal proprietorship in the library which it is
desirable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_449" id="Page_449">[449]</a></span>
that he should possess. Other reasons for the open access
system are the opportunities it gives for close contact between
the child and the librarian, of the opportunities it gives the child
of learning what treasures are at his disposal, in addition to
every other advantage which may be said to accrue to the system
when used for adult readers. The hours of opening should be
governed by the school hours; that is to say, it is hardly
ever necessary to open during school hours; and the library
should close at a reasonable hour in order that children may not
be induced to remain there at times when they ought to be in
their homes. These hours differ in different localities. At
holiday times, however, the library should be accessible during
the greater part of the daytime.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec492">492.</h4>

<p><b>492.</b> Discipline, it has been well remarked, is the problem of
the children&#8217;s department. While the dragooning methods of
the parish beadle would be deplorably out of place, it is impossible
to agree with the American librarian who declares that &#8220;children
usually do not mind noise and crowding,&#8221; because, even if in
theory they do not, it is impossible to carry on effective work
in conditions of congestion and noise. Too precise a method
would defeat its object, but it would seem wise to limit the
admissions at any time to such numbers as may be controlled
easily by the librarian. Mr L. Stanley Jast has gone so far as
to affirm that the children should not be more than can easily
be &#8220;contacted by the librarian,&#8221; on the ground that more
efficient work can thus be done. It is a matter upon which a
decision can only be made from a knowledge of the conditions
and the character of the child population. Clearly, however, a
qualification in a successful children&#8217;s librarian is the power to
keep order, to prevent practical joking, loud conversation and
laughter in the reading room. Firmness displayed with kindness,
but with decision, and the excluding of unrepentant
offenders have been found to be effective.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec493">493.</h4>

<p><b>493.</b> The training of the children&#8217;s librarian is special and
necessary. In England it has not been developed in any degree
commensurate with the need, and our ideals in this matter must
be drawn from our American cousins. They require a sound
preliminary education in the candidate, a knowledge of the
broader lines of general library administration, and, added to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_450" id="Page_450">[450]</a></span>
these, a study of the child mind, practical social service work,
the study of the bibliography of juvenile literature, and practice&mdash;usually
gained by actual work in children&#8217;s rooms&mdash;in story-telling,
subject-hunting, bulletin-making, and similar matters.
Cataloguing, classification, the preparing of attractive lists, etc.,
for children are all somewhat modified from the forms in use in
the grown people&#8217;s departments, and all are treated specially.
All these studies premise that the librarian has the requisite
&#8220;personality,&#8221; and this is a matter of natural inheritance rather
than of training. In Europe this special training can only be
gained in the children&#8217;s room, and, as a matter of fact, is not
always gained. Too often librarians have perforce been obliged
to hand the conduct of the department to any member of the
staff who might be available at the time. This state of affairs
must receive attention if the children&#8217;s department is to accomplish
its purpose. Probably the ordinary training of the Froebel
system superadded to general library training is the best preparation
that can be given to the British children&#8217;s librarian at
present.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec494">494. Activities of the Department.</h4>

<p><b>494. Activities of the Department.</b>&mdash;To bring the child into
contact with the proper book is the aim of the department.
Free choice amongst books will suffice in a number of instances;
but such passive methods will not always secure good results.
The assistant in charge must win the confidence of the children
and guide them in the most unobtrusive manner possible to the
books likely to be of interest and use. Various active methods
are in use to gain this end. The most popular of these is the
Story Hour.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec495">495.</h4>

<p><b>495.</b> It has been premised that children from six to fourteen
years of age will frequent the department, and there is a vast
range of ability and taste in children in the various years between
these ages. Little children require simple large-print books
with plenty of illustrations, and may be drawn to them if story-telling
forms part of the librarian&#8217;s activities. Story hours,
indeed, are most attractive to children of all ages. They are
given informally, the children usually being grouped round the
librarian in a half-circle while she tells them a fairy story, or
stories drawn from the greater writers, from history, poetry, or
what not. The connexion between the story hour and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_451" id="Page_451">[451]</a></span>
after reading of the books which contain the stories is clear.
Such story-telling requires special and intelligent study, good
elocution, fluency and the sense of the dramatic. The objection
frequently offered to the work is that it is harmful to children
for them to hear a story by a great writer delivered in inferior
language and brokenly by an indifferent librarian. This, however,
is purely a matter of experience and training, and there are
admirable manuals of story-telling method by Miss Marie Shedlock,
Miss L. M. Olcott, and others which may help in this
matter. Otherwise the value of the work is undoubted. The
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh sets the standard which has
general approval. There it is found that groups of thirty
children are convenient in size, although it is often necessary to
have larger groups. &#8220;To the younger children miscellaneous
stories are told, selected chiefly from the folk-tales of various
countries, legends, myths, fables, modern realistic stories and
Bible stories. Two stories are usually told to each group, and
whenever possible variety is given by the selection of stories of
different types. Poems and nursery rhymes are occasionally
included in these programmes. Special days are celebrated if
stories can be found which express the spirit of the holiday and
are sufficiently dramatic in form. The same stories are sometimes
repeated during the year because of the deeper impression
made through repetition, and the value to children of an intimate
acquaintance with a few of the best things in literature appropriate
for them. If something new is given each time, the impressions
are confused and dissipated, and material which is
either beyond a child&#8217;s appreciation or unsuitable for story-telling
must finally be used. When an additional story is told,
and the children are allowed a choice, the story requested is
almost without exception a very old and well-known one. To
the older children some of the great cycle stories are presented
by telling one story each week. High adventure and romance,
as depicted in these hero tales, have a special appeal to the boy
and girl from ten to fifteen, and at this age interest is easily
sustained.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec496">496.</h4>

<p><b>496.</b> More formal lectures prove entirely successful with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_452" id="Page_452">[452]</a></span>
children, the difficulty as a rule being to find accommodation
for the numbers who desire to attend them. They differ from
lectures given to adults principally in the fact that they are
simpler, but not always even in this particular. Lecturing to
children demands a freedom of manner and from mannerisms,
decision and fluency; and it will be found that the audience is
one of the most critical a lecturer can encounter. All the conditions
of definite, clear and accurate subject-matter, refined
humour, etc., which are required in books are also required in
the lecture. Such subjects as the history of inventions and
historical episodes appeal strongly to boys, but perhaps not so
greatly to girls, who find nature, literary and similar lectures
more to their taste&mdash;although dogmatic statement on this point
is entirely unwise. The judicious use of lantern slides, pictures
and exhibits enhances these lectures, but many subjects are
better treated without them. Pictures of characters in works
of imagination, for example, often destroy the child&#8217;s own, and
therefore more valuable, conception of the characters. Good
discipline is essential to successful lectures, and this depends
upon the lecturer; uneasiness in the audience usually means
that it is bored, and the lecturer is wise to consider it thus.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec497">497.</h4>

<p><b>497.</b> Reading clubs and circles often form part of the activities
of the department. In these the members, who are admitted
to them formally, undertake to read through some special book
under the guidance of a leader who, of course, may be a member
of the library staff, although an older child may be induced to
become leader. Usually the children read the prescribed portion
of the book privately, and at the circle they go over it, talk about
it, ask questions, and look at pictures, maps and other books
that may throw more light on their reading or increase its interest.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec498">498.</h4>

<p><b>498.</b> A valuable auxiliary of story hours, lectures and reading
circles is a collection of illustrations. Such collections are
becoming a feature of some British, and have long been used in
American, libraries. The collection is made up of illustrations
abstracted from all suitable sources, worn-out books, periodicals,
catalogues, advertisements, etc., in addition to pictures separately
published. Each picture is mounted individually upon a
mount of standard size&mdash;12<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches by 10<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches for the greater
number, and 17 inches by 13<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches for larger pictures
have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_453" id="Page_453">[453]</a></span>
been proved to be quite suitable&mdash;of manila, art paper, or some
similar stiff material; and the pictures are minutely classified,
and may be filed in closed pamphlet boxes, or, better, vertically
in a filing cabinet. Systematic abstracting of such illustrations
for the available sources of an ordinary library will soon produce
a large collection. The rule to be observed is that the pictures
must illustrate some fact, scene or object. Pictures from the
average modern novel, views of scenes which may be found in
any country, &#8220;pretty&#8221; pictures, etc., have practically no value.
An exception may be made in favour of illustrations of classic
works by distinguished artists, but for the reasons advanced
against lantern slides in illustrating such works even this is
doubtful. The collection should be available not only in the
department, they should also be lent to teachers for use in
class work in school and to reading circles and other people who
may desire to use them. Such pictures may form the basis of
what is called bulletin work. On suitable occasions, holidays,
birthdays of great men, anniversaries of all kinds, and as illustrating
current events, pictures should be displayed on screens
in the room in conjunction with brief lists of illustrative books.
Sometimes bulletins are specially made for such occasions if an
assistant with the necessary artistic ability is available; attractive
borders, small appropriate sketches and similar embellishments
are added to the pictures and lists. It is possible, however,
that the bulletin may exercise too great a fascination over its
maker and too much time be spent upon it; but within limits
the bulletin is an excellent device for drawing the attention of
children.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec499">499.</h4>

<p><b>499.</b> At all seasonable times additional activities recommend
themselves, but extravagance should be avoided. Exhibits of
many kinds, wild flowers in their seasons, and the common objects
and fauna of the district, are frequently displayed with satisfactory
results; and, indeed, on every opportunity the librarian
should make the room of current living interest to the children.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec500">500.</h4>

<p><b>500.</b> In almost all these activities voluntary help from interested
people may be had and should be welcomed. Large
picture collections have in some places been provided almost
entirely by this means, and every town has people in it who
would help as lecturers, leaders of circles, collectors and
arrangers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_454" id="Page_454">[454]</a></span>
of exhibits. The wider the lay interest taken in the department,
provided it is directed judiciously, the greater its success is
likely to be.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec501">501. Library Lessons.</h4>

<p><b>501. Library Lessons.</b>&mdash;Library lessons may form a useful
part of the activities of the department. Teachers may bring
their classes to the libraries in school hours and give lessons on
subjects in connexion with the ordinary school lessons. Such
lessons are frequently given in the Cardiff children&#8217;s rooms, and
in giving them the teachers use the books, illustrations, maps and
other material in the rooms, and are able to reinforce these with
books or materials from the adult departments. There is a
novelty in lessons given in such conditions which removes them in
the child&#8217;s mind from ordinary lessons and gives them emphasis.
A pleasure is added to them if the children are allowed a space
at their conclusion in which they may indulge in individual
reading according to their own choice from the shelves.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec502">502.</h4>

<p><b>502.</b> The library is perhaps more directly concerned with
lessons in which the library itself is the subject taught, and these
lessons fall to the staff. A preliminary lesson may consist of a
simple demonstration of the purpose and means of access to the
library&mdash;its divisions, cataloguing and classification, and an
exercise in finding books; and this may be followed by other
lessons on the making, use and care of books; and other lessons
may follow on reference work, subject-hunting, the use of
periodical indexes, bibliographical aids, dictionaries, maps, etc.
They must be purely objective to succeed, and everything
described should be placed before the children. These lessons
are also given as a rule in school hours, and inspectors have shown
themselves willing to regard them as part of the school curriculum.
Their value both to the children and to the libraries is very great.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec503">503. Classification and Cataloguing.</h4>

<p><b>503. Classification and Cataloguing.</b>&mdash;The classification and
catalogue methods of the department should be preliminary to
those of the adult departments; but they may be simpler with
advantage. Young children would probably find the decimal
classification in its orthodox form too intricate. At the same
time the system that they use should be in its essentials the
main classification of the library. The following simplified
form of the decimal system may be suggestive; it is not meant
to be more than that:</p>

<p><b>504.</b> Similar principles may well govern the cataloguing of
the children&#8217;s library. It is well that youngsters should become
familiar with the arrangement and use of sheaf and card as well
as of printed catalogues. Moreover, the Anglo-American code
is here the best basis upon which to do the cataloguing. It
should be remembered that the children use the catalogue, or
ought to use it, and not adults. All recondite bibliographical
terms, and abbreviations except the simplest, should be avoided;
and explanatory notes should be written in language such as the
children may be expected to understand. Indeed, a rule that
all cataloguing should be expressed in such language&mdash;we mean
all that is added to the title&mdash;would be a safe one to follow.
Some extended rules, with examples, which may prove helpful
in this matter are given in Berwick Sayers&#8217;s <i>The Children&#8217;s
Library</i>, chapter iii. It will be seen that no particular <i>form</i>
of catalogue is recommended; librarians differ widely upon this
question. Perhaps the best printed catalogue is that issued for
schools by the Pittsburgh Library: a catalogue in divisions
corresponding to the grades in the schools, in which each division
contains books which are thought to make appeal to the children
in the grade it represents.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec505">505.</h4>

<p><b>505.</b> Reading lists follow the same rules. These, to make any
useful appeal, should be presented simply, attractively, and be
rigidly selective. A few titles, well presented, are likely to have
more effect than lists so long that they frighten the child.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIII<br />
<span class="title">THE LIBRARY AND THE SCHOOL</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec506">506.</h4>

<p><b>506.</b> If libraries are an integral part of the educational system,
it is clear that their relations with schools and with the teachers
must be close. This is perhaps more cordially recognized in
America than here, but there are few librarians who do not
endeavour to establish a connexion between their libraries and
the official teaching system of their towns. In the simplest
instance special privileges are offered to teachers enabling them
to borrow from five to twelve or more books at a time for class
work. In some towns meetings of teachers and library staffs
are held in order that mutual work may be discussed and
arranged. In a few places there are special libraries for teachers;
and in some American libraries not only are there these special
libraries, but the teachers are provided with keys which give
them access when other parts of the libraries are closed. One
of the privileges of the public library is to encourage teachers
to make the fullest use of books.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec507">507.</h4>

<p><b>507.</b> It is gradually becoming recognized that a school without
a library lacks an important part of its equipment. In colleges
and high schools this has been recognized practically for some
years past, but in few but the largest schools have separate rooms
been assigned for library purposes, in the care of an assistant
trained in the work. A teacher whose principal business is
teaching has usually been thought to be a person sufficiently
qualified for the work, with the result that rarely have the
libraries been exploited to anything like the full measure of their
possibilities. They are places where books are read or from
which books are lent, not places where readers are created,
information disseminated, or the practical use of books taught.
In fact, one of the absurd gaps in our higher school curriculum
is the want of teaching in the book, in the elements of bibliography;
and until this is filled our school system must be pronounced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_458" id="Page_458">[458]</a></span>
to be incomplete. American methods deserve study,
with a view to their adaptability to British conditions; and
such works as Gilbert O. Ward&#8217;s <i>The High School Library</i>, in
the <i>A. L. A. Manual of Library Economy</i> (as showing the field
and its possibilities), and Florence M. Hopkins&#8217;s <i>Reference Guides
that Should be Known, and How to Use Them</i> (as showing a
practical method in one part of library teaching), will repay
such study.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec508">508.</h4>

<p><b>508.</b> In council and similar elementary schools the municipal
library has one of its best fields of work. Under the present
restricted financial conditions of libraries, however, it is necessary
to say that the provision of reading matter in the schools
should be a charge against educational funds and not against
those of the library, which are already altogether insufficient for
ordinary work. It is at the same time probable that this
work, in so far as book-selection and purchase, cataloguing and
classification, binding, and other details of organization and
administration are concerned, can be done better and more
economically by the librarian than by the teacher, and should
accordingly be directed by the library committee. The theory
of the work is that while the librarian is the best person to
organize the school library, the teacher is the best person to
bring books and children together. Some education authorities
make special grants for this work, varying from a few to several
hundreds of pounds yearly; but before we describe the methods
most generally approved, we may make mention of the various
unaided efforts that librarians have made to meet the needs of
schools. One is to invite the teacher to obtain, upon his own
signature, a ticket for every child whom he considers to be of
reading age; to permit him to borrow the number of books
represented by such tickets; and to retain them so long as he
thinks necessary for their due circulation. Three months is an
average loan period. A second is to waive the ticket-taking
preliminary and to lend the teacher a number of books for a
few weeks or months for lending as he thinks good amongst the
scholars. There have been many variations of these two
methods, but they are obviously one in principle; and, useful
as they no doubt are, they are also obviously limited, as few
British libraries have a large enough stock of books of the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_459" id="Page_459">[459]</a></span>
kind to lend in this way to all the schools in the town which
might require the privilege. School libraries to be lastingly
effective require a separate stock with many duplicates, and
these no ordinary public library can, in present circumstances,
provide.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec509">509.</h4>

<p><b>509.</b> Co-operation between library and education committees
seems to be the best method of achieving satisfactory school
libraries. By this method the education committee provides
the funds, the libraries the administration, and the teachers the
actual service amongst the children. Wherever there is a
children&#8217;s department at the public library it ought to be the
centre from which all the libraries in the town should be organized,
supplied and co-ordinated. Again, to secure any success,
the closest co-operation is necessary between teachers and
librarians. This is generally forthcoming, but frequently is not,
for reasons made clear to the editor of this <i>Manual</i> by a prominent
teacher, who writes: &#8220;I do not like the circulating of libraries
from school to school&mdash;it is most unsatisfactory. I know the
need of the children in my school more exactly than anyone else,
and I do not want books dumped on me that my children will
not read.&#8221; Moreover, it was affirmed that the books chosen
by librarians were unsuitable as being &#8220;too adult.&#8221; It is clear,
however, that the only real difficulty raised here is that to the
exchange of the collections between the schools. All the other
difficulties can be, and are, overcome by the co-operation which
is postulated for the work.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec510">510.</h4>

<p><b>510.</b> The control of such school libraries takes several forms.
In the simplest the education authority grants a certain sum
yearly to the library committee for children&#8217;s work, making only
the condition that library service on their behalf shall be efficient.
In other cases the education authority desires to take a more
definite part in the work, and it has been found that a sub-committee,
consisting of members of the library and education committees
and of representatives of the head teachers, with the
librarian as executive officer, will work satisfactorily. Such a
sub-committee should be free from the limitations imposed upon
subordinate bodies, and although it should report its activities, it
should not be expected to submit them to the respective committees.
Friction is soon generated if the sub-committe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_460" id="Page_460">[460]</a></span>e&#8217;s
book-selection, or indeed any other feature of its work, is liable
to amendment by another body, and we have known really good
library schemes to come to grief through such interference.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec511">511.</h4>

<p><b>511.</b> A grant for school libraries should consist of an initial
capital sum for equipment and stock, and an annual sum for
additions and maintenance. Grants vary from about &pound;500 to
&pound;25 per annum, and the amounts, of course, are conditioned by
the size of the town and the number of schools to be served, as
also by the current cost of furniture, books and service, all of
which are at present in a state of great fluctuation. A good
arrangement is that in operation at Cardiff, where the Education
Committee grants &pound;2, 10s. yearly for every hundred children
permanently on the school registers. The work of preparing,
cataloguing and classifying the books is carried out by the library
staff as a whole in small libraries, or by the children&#8217;s library
staff where one exists, or by a special school libraries assistant.
In providing the commencing stock, a few decisions must be made
upon which the future usefulness of the libraries will largely
depend: (1) the period for which books are to remain at each
school; (2) the desirability of an unchanging deposit collection
at each school; (3) the method of charging at the schools; (4) the
methods of recording the whereabouts of each book. And there
are other matters.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec512">512.</h4>

<p><b>512.</b> The period of loan to each school varies from three to
twelve months, and the smaller the available stocks of books,
the more frequent should be the changing of them. Frequent
changes, however, involve much labour, and it is well that
the collections should be as large as possible at the outset in
order that they may serve efficiently for longer periods than three
months. They should not remain longer than a year, as by that
time the interest of the collection will be much reduced and the
books themselves will probably be in need of overhauling. It
is a good thing to have a basic, unchanging collection at each
school, consisting of the books which by common consent are
children&#8217;s classics. These will naturally be duplicated in most
of the schools, as the list of such books is by no means a long one.
Their existence gives assurance that every child has access to the
best of children&#8217;s books during his school career. The ultimate
aim should be to increase the school collections so that periodical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_461" id="Page_461">[461]</a></span>
interchange between the schools becomes unnecessary, except
in so far as additions of new books are concerned.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec513">513. Cataloguing.</h4>

<p><b>513. Cataloguing.</b>&mdash;The accession and cataloguing methods
may resemble those described for Rural Libraries (<a href="#Sec546">Sections
546</a>-<a href="#Sec547">47</a>). One suggestions-slip may serve for any number of
copies, the accession numbers being added to the card; this
forms an inventory of the stock. For each copy another
catalogue card, in very brief form, should be written, which may
be placed behind a guide card bearing the name of the school at
which the copy is located. A printed catalogue of the whole of
the school library system is a very useful thing, but is difficult
to maintain. In any case a list of the books sent to the school
should accompany each dispatch.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec514">514. Charging.</h4>

<p><b>514. Charging.</b>&mdash;The head teacher usually appoints a school
librarian, who may be a teacher, but is more often a senior
scholar, and to the school librarian is entrusted the issuing of
books and the keeping of the necessary records. The charging
system will be some simplified form of that in use at the public
library. A card-charging system has been found to be satisfactory.
Trays, pockets, and properly-written book-cards are
provided by the library staff, and a supply of readers&#8217; tickets
which are made out by the school librarian as required.
Another method is that described in <a href="#Sec547">Section 547</a>, which can
be adapted readily to school libraries. Scholars are usually
allowed to change books once a week, during a special &#8220;library
hour,&#8221; which is recognized officially as part of school time;
but this is a matter of local arrangement.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec515">515.</h4>

<p><b>515.</b> Usually the work of book-selection is performed by the
School Libraries Committee. It has a drawback in the fact that
teachers do not always receive the exact books that they wish
to have for their schools, and a better method, at least in theory,
is for the librarian to submit a list of the books available for purchase
to the teachers, and to invite them to requisition those
which they think suitable. This would forestall a very frequent
criticism made by teachers; nor would the librarian experience
any great difficulty in meeting the demands so made.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec516">516.</h4>

<p><b>516.</b> The period for which a collection should remain at a
school is conveniently governed by the school holidays. The
summer vacation presents the best opportunity for overhauling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_462" id="Page_462">[462]</a></span>
the whole system, and where there is accommodation at the
central library, and other circumstances permit, it is well to have
all the collections returned there, where they may be weeded of
defective and dirty books, repairs may be executed, binding
arranged for, stock may be taken, and the new location of the
collections determined, so that every school may recommence
with a new library. But in the intervals between holidays
periodical visits to the schools should be made by the schools<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_463" id="Page_463">[463]</a></span>
librarian to see that the books are in order, to advise where
necessary, and in other ways to maintain relations between the
school and the public library. Sometimes the librarian addresses
the children in the schools, upon reading or other library subjects.
This visiting work should be done with tact and unobtrusively.
Frequently teachers prefer to be allowed to work
without the intervention of the librarian, and such preferences
must be respected. The business of the librarian is to supply<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_464" id="Page_464">[464]</a></span>
books, and <i>not</i> necessarily to exploit them&mdash;so far, at least, as
schools are concerned.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec517">517.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>517.</b> Returns of the circulation are regarded as necessary by
most librarians, and have a variety of uses, as every librarian
recognizes. These are usually made monthly to the librarian.
The <a href="#Fig177A">card</a> shown has proved satisfactory in practice.</p>

<p>Teachers, it must be added, do not always see the values of
these returns, and may consider them an irritating and unnecessary
superfluity. If they could be made in the form of an
estimate once a year the purpose might be served.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec518">518.</h4>

<p><b>518.</b> The head teacher should not be held responsible in a
financial sense for lost books, nor should he be expected or permitted
to replace them. He would, however, be expected to
take reasonable steps to recover them, and in case of loss, a
penalty of some kind, however small, is generally inflicted upon
the loser. Books which have been in contact with infectious
disease are sent from the home to the Public Health Department,
where they are disinfected, or, in some places, destroyed, at the
discretion of the Medical Officer of Health. Some sanitary
authorities themselves replace the books which are destroyed.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec519">519.</h4>

<p><b>519.</b> At what time in the history of school libraries the collections
should cease to circulate between the schools and become
permanent libraries in individual schools is a matter upon which
opinion differs. At Cardiff this stage was reached when there
were 600 volumes in the large school, and no school with less
than 200. Allowing the average time in which a child will use
the library, to be four years, the lesser of these figures provides
that each child may read at least one volume a week throughout
that time; but it is impossible to allow the child a choice of
books in these circumstances, and this is a very grave defect.
It can only be affirmed that there should be at least one book for
every child of reading age, and that this minimum should be
increased as rapidly as possible.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec520">520.</h4>

<p><b>520.</b> Other fields for the public library presented by the schools
may be indicated briefly. They may be used as deposit stations
for adult readers in anticipation of the establishment of permanent
branch libraries; and this method has met with success.
The head teacher, too, should be allowed the right of requisitioning
temporarily any books in the public lending libraries<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_465" id="Page_465">[465]</a></span>
which may be desirable for the use of the scholars in connexion
with their class studies; and a generous policy in lending works
from the reference library for use in the school building is a
natural corollary of this.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec521">521. Sunday School Libraries</h4>

<p><b>521. Sunday School Libraries</b> have not received much attention
from British public librarians. They present a useful field
of work, in which the municipal library may suggest books and
methods and offer simple training in library practice to the
teachers. As is the case with all other teachers, the stores of the
public library should be made available for their use in the widest
sense.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec522">522.</h4>

<p><b>522.</b> Finally, the teachers themselves are entitled to the most
careful attention. At training schools there should be special
libraries of pedagogy; and at the public library an effort should
be made to place a catholic and fully representative collection of
works on all branches of teaching, theory and practice at the
disposal of teachers.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec523">523.</h4>

<p><b>523.</b> All these matters lead up to the ultimate object of the
librarian, which is to establish a natural pathway from the
schools to the public library. Vouchers of admission should be
placed at the disposal of the schools, and the recommendation
of the head teacher may procure readers&#8217; tickets for all children
leaving school. Fortunately most teachers see the importance
of the matter, and a properly systematized connexion is therefore
made for the child between the school library and the much
larger and more permanently useful stores of the municipal
library.</p>

<h2>DIVISION XIV<br />
LIBRARY DEVELOPMENT</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />
<span class="title">THE LECTURE ROOM</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec526">526. Lecture Room and Platform.</h4>

<p><b>526. Lecture Room and Platform.</b>&mdash;Library development is a
somewhat elastic term covering the various active measures
taken by librarians to attract readers. It is now a commonplace
that while the prime purpose of the library is to supply and
circulate literature&mdash;that is to say, everything in literary form
from books to news-cuttings&mdash;modern librarians increasingly
adopt the point of view that it is part of their duty and privilege
to create readers. Of the various ways in which this is done
lecture and similar work stands prominent. In the design of
libraries provision should always be made for a lecture room
with adequate accommodation for an audience, chaired comfortably,
equipped with lantern and screen, a platform, and
blackboard and similar accessories. The platform deserves
care in its design; it should have an electric lantern signal communicating
with the lanternist, and for scientific and technical
demonstrations, water, gas, and a movable electric light should
be brought to it. The platform is better for being large enough
to accommodate a number of persons for dramatic readings,
musical parties, etc.; should be approached by a door from the
back; and curtain arrangements for it are desirable. The
construction should be solid, and the platform floor should be
covered with a thick cork or other matting to deaden the
distracting sound of shuffling feet.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec527">527. Lectures and Lecture Societies.</h4>

<p><b>527. Lectures and Lecture Societies.</b>&mdash;Lectures of two kinds
may be given&mdash;those provided by societies who merely use the
library, and those arranged by the library itself. Of the former
kind many can be arranged by placing the lecture-room at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_468" id="Page_468">[468]</a></span>
disposal of local scientific societies, branches of University
Extension, the Workers&#8217; Educational Association, and similar
bodies, non-sectarian and non-political, which have an educational
or partly educational purpose. These should not involve
the staff in much labour, or the library in much expense, although
there are cases where the librarian or a member of his staff acts
as organizing secretary to such societies. Every effort to centre
these activities in the library can be justified; the object is to
make the library the intellectual centre of the town; but it
should be understood that the staff cannot develop into mere
lecture agents, or conduct such work at the expense of the main
purpose of the library. Where the staff is sufficient this objection
does not apply, although it is perhaps well to say that the
library should not duplicate work of this kind which other
institutions in the town are doing efficiently. A discriminating
use of voluntary workers, who are frequently forthcoming, is
a solution of many difficulties.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec528">528.</h4>

<p><b>528.</b> It is doubtful whether it is legal for library committees
to arrange lectures; certainly expenditure upon them has been
questioned at times of audit; but various ways of overcoming
this difficulty have been discovered. One is to form a lecture
society which is a separate organization using the lecture-room,
and this raises subscriptions, sells programmes, etc., and so
defrays expenses; this has been done at Walthamstow and
Newark-upon-Trent. The more frequent way is to obtain
voluntary lecturers and to keep the running expenses at a
negligible figure; most towns have acceptable lecturers who
are willing to serve the public in this way. In some towns, not
subject to Government audit, as in Liverpool, great miscellaneous
series of lectures are arranged by the libraries, not because they
are regarded as a library activity, but because the Libraries
Committee is regarded as the most convenient committee for
doing this desirable public work.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec529">529.</h4>

<p><b>529.</b> Librarians differ as to the value of courses of lectures as
compared with individual miscellaneous lectures. The course
certainly provides information more or less exhaustive, and is
of more benefit to the fewer people who attend it; but they are
few; and on the other hand it is argued that it is no part of the
function of the library to teach in the manner implied in a set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_469" id="Page_469">[469]</a></span>
course, but rather to stimulate interest in various subjects with
direct reference to books. This latter object should influence
all such activities as those we are considering; there seems to
be little justification for lectures or exhibitions organized by the
library which do not definitely lead to the use of libraries.
Random lectures have a value of their own, but they are not
our province. When, therefore, a syllabus of lectures is drawn
up, it should be accompanied by brief reading lists on the subjects
chosen. In this way lectures on topography (there are usually
too many of these, however), art, science, literature, or indeed
any subject, may be a direct incentive to reading, and in some
places this is emphasized by the use of lantern slides and
&#8220;privilege&#8221; issues.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec530">530. Organization.</h4>

<p><b>530. Organization.</b>&mdash;Much labour can be saved by the use of
a few simple methods in organizing lectures. Invitations to
lecturers should never be on stereotyped circular forms, but
should be individual personal letters, especially where the
lecturer is not to receive a fee, but he may be asked to reply
on a definite memorandum (see <a href="#Fig178">Fig. 178</a>, <a href="#Page_470">p. 470</a>).</p>

<p>A circular of information should also be enclosed describing the
conditions of the lectures, the library at which they are held, the
way to reach it, and, in particular, drawing attention to their
purpose of calling notice to books, and inviting suggestions as
to the best books on the subjects. A stamped addressed envelope
for reply, which the librarian may apologize for enclosing
on the ground that it will save the lecturer&#8217;s time, should not
be forgotten. The memoranda, when returned, can be filed for
reference, and their use enables the needs of the lecturers to be
met completely.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec531">531.</h4>

<p><b>531.</b> The syllabus should give the list of lectures, conditions
of admission, the hour and place of their delivery, and contain
the reading lists. These last, as indicated already, should be
brief; a long list of references defeats its own object, because
readers are frightened by it. Half a dozen carefully-selected
titles are usually enough. Syllabuses should be distributed free
to readers in the library; and little other advertisement is necessary.
A small poster giving the programme, of such size that
tradesmen will place it in their shops, clergy and ministers in
church porches, and may be displayed in other places, has its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_470" id="Page_470">[470]</a></span>
uses; and sometimes an advertisement in the local papers has
a good effect. For special lectures, for which an attendance
larger than the lecture-room will hold is expected, tickets of
admission may be used, which can be distributed free. The
back of these tickets can be used for reading lists.</p>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 178.</span>&mdash;Lecturer&#8217;s Memorandum (<a href="#Sec530">Section 530</a>).</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec532">532. Lantern Slides.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>532. Lantern Slides.</b>&mdash;The lantern is used at many lectures,
and is a valuable auxiliary. All lists of books should be transferred
to lantern slides, and displayed at the beginning or end
of the lecture, and&mdash;this is the important point&mdash;the lecturer
should be persuaded to comment upon them. Clear glass-slides
with a surface prepared to take pen writing in india or even
ordinary ink can be obtained at any photographic chemist; but
if expense is a consideration, a simple method is to obtain
lantern slide cover-glasses, which cost a few pence the dozen,
make a solution with one per cent. of Nelson&#8217;s photographic
gelatine in warm water, apply this to the cover-glasses with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_471" id="Page_471">[471]</a></span>
sponge or soft cloth, and in a few minutes they will be dry and
will take pen-writing admirably. The cover-glasses can be
cleaned after use, re-coated, and used again as often as necessary.
For general illustrative lantern slides it is very useful to
take out a subscription with one of the circulating collections of
lantern slides, as E. G. Wood&#8217;s in Cheapside. These issue
catalogues which may be lent to prospective lecturers, who may
then draw upon these collections. The accessibility of slides
often secures a lecturer. Librarians can use slides in a number
of ways, to illustrate contents of books, the differing character
and scope of works of reference, and bring home the use of books
in a way that no other method can be made to do. So far we
do not know of a library that has a cinematograph installation;
but some libraries already collect films, and the uses of the
cinematograph will one day be recognized. The most valuable
projection apparatus of all is the epidiascope, which projects
illustrations, pages of books, and solid objects from these actual
things, and does not require lantern slides. It is, however,
rather expensive, and requires skill in manipulation, but it would
be an excellent investment for any large library.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec533">533. Privilege Issues.</h4>

<p><b>533. Privilege Issues.</b>&mdash;In order to bring readers to the books
on any subject while it is fresh in mind Mr Jast initiated a method
of privilege issue. The books on the subject of the lecture are
displayed on tables in the lecture-room, so that the audience may
examine them before the lecture. On the tables is the following
announcement:</p>

<div class="privilege" id="Fig179">

<p class="center highline2">PRIVILEGE ISSUE.</p>

<p>Any one of these books may be <span class="smcap">Borrowed
without a Ticket</span> by any resident whose
name appears in the local directory.</p>

<p>To obtain a book, all that is necessary is
that the borrower shall sign his (or her) name
and address on the slip provided. Such signing
will be taken as indicating that the book
will be returned to the library within 15 days,
and that payment will be made for undue
detention, damage, or loss, as provided for in
the Library Rules.</p>

</div><!--privilege-->

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 179.</span>&mdash;Privilege Issue Notice (<a href="#Sec533">Section 533</a>).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_472" id="Page_472">[472]</a></span></p>

<p class="blankbefore noindent">The issues are made at the conclusion of the lecture. The slip
mentioned is of ordinary paper of a size suitable to be used in
orthodox card-charging, and plays the same part in the charge
as a borrower&#8217;s permanent ticket. The book is stamped and
issued to the applicant in the usual way, and a long narrow
slip bearing the following text is inserted:</p>

<div class="privilege" id="Fig180">

<p class="center highline2">PRIVILEGE ISSUE.</p>

<p>This book is issued on the distinct understanding
that it is returned to one of the
Lending Libraries within 15 days. Or, if kept
longer, the Library fine of 1d. per week (or
portion of a week) for such detention will
be paid, together with any cost of notification;
also that any damage or loss will be
made good.</p>

<p>This being a &#8220;privilege&#8221; issue, it does not
entitle the reader to another book in exchange.
If, however, the reader is not a member of the
Lending Libraries, he should return the accompanying
Application Form, properly filled up,
along with this book, when he will be allowed
to take another book at the time of return,
and thenceforth exercise the privileges of
membership.</p>

</div><!--privilege-->

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 180.</span>&mdash;Privilege Issue Information
Slip<br />(<a href="#Sec533">Section 533</a>).</p>

<p class="blankbefore">A voucher of application for membership goes with this, and
borrowers frequently return it filled and become regular readers.
The charges when made are inserted into the ordinary sequence
of the day&#8217;s issues, and there is no distinction between them and
the card charges made for regular borrowers&#8217; books. This privilege
service was extended to accredited societies in the town,
who undertook to issue and to secure the due return of the books.
So far we know of only two libraries that have adopted the
system of privilege issues; but it has been successful, and has
not, so far, entailed any loss of books.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec534">534. General.</h4>

<p><b>534. General.</b>&mdash;Lecturers should be reminded of their engagement
a few days before each lecture. Nothing should be taken
for granted. The lecturer&#8217;s instructions should be gone over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_473" id="Page_473">[473]</a></span>
carefully, and the state of the lantern screen, lantern, platform,
signals and other accessories examined in time for any fault to
be corrected. Attention to such details makes for success,
while nothing is more annoying to lecturer and audience than a
fault in such things.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec535">535. Library Readings.</h4>

<p><b>535. Library Readings.</b>&mdash;Library readings revive, in a manner,
the once famous popular penny readings; but in their new form
such readings are free and are of subjects chosen because of their
value and not primarily because they entertain. It is found
that audiences are not only ready to listen to lectures about
books, they are also ready to listen to readings from the books
themselves. For some years at Southwark Mr R. W. Mould
read <i>The Christmas Carol</i> and other famous works aloud to
large audiences of library people. There is scarcely any limit
to books that may be read aloud in this way&mdash;nearly all the
novelists, poets, letter-writers, essayists, humorists, diarists
can be used; and these are fairly easy for a good reader to deal
with. But the reader must be a good one; poor reading is worse
than none. It is usual for the reader to give a brief introductory
sketch of his author, and to link the readings by connecting
remarks. It is really remarkable to note the willingness of
audiences to listen to readings of books which &#8220;everybody
has read&#8221;; perhaps because they revive pleasant
memories; probably, too, because the reading reveals unsuspected
qualities in the book read. A more difficult, but even
more interesting, type of reading may be made upon a subject,
which is explained and illustrated from various authors; for
example, on &#8220;Volcanoes, the genesis and development of scientific
theory regarding them.&#8221; In this case an extract was read
from Judd&#8217;s <i>Volcanoes</i> defining a volcano and presenting the
ideas of the Greeks upon the subject; then extracts from the
two Plinys; then the medi&aelig;val views were drawn from Pietro
Toledo; Sir William Hamilton afforded an account of Vesuvius
in eruption in 1767; and later matter was drawn from Eli&eacute; de
Beaumont, Scrope, Dana, Judd, Bonney, Anderson and Flint,
and Heilprintz. Such a reading has proved most successful.
These, too, can be illustrated with lantern slides, and the obvious
value of slides showing titles, extracts, maps, etc., from books
from which the readings are drawn need not be emphasized.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_474" id="Page_474">[474]</a></span>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec536">536.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>536.</b> Another form is the dramatic reading, and this is the
most acceptable of all when it is well done, and its value is undeniable
from the library point of view. In it a party of readers,
each taking a character, read a play without scenery, costume, or
action other than is necessary to make clear a movement which
the scene requires and the text does not convey. Such plays
as Hardy&#8217;s <i>Dynasts</i>, most of Shakespeare&#8217;s plays, etc., have
been dealt with in this manner; but the peculiar value of the
dramatic reading is to draw attention to great plays, which
are seldom read or performed, such as the miracle plays, the
Elizabethans other than Shakespeare, and Browning&#8217;s various
plays (for example); and series by well-known writers who in
individual manner deal with the same subject, such as was done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_475" id="Page_475">[475]</a></span>

Cleopatra</i>, Dryden&#8217;s <i>All for Love</i> and Bernard Shaw&#8217;s <i>C&aelig;sar and
Cleopatra</i>&mdash;which were given in three successive weeks with
great success. All that has been said of the necessity of focussing
the work on the actual authors, plays, and works about them
by means of lists, applies as strongly here as elsewhere.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec537">537. Exhibitions.</h4>

<p><b>537. Exhibitions.</b>&mdash;-A few simple arrangements make the
lecture-room convenient for exhibitions of books, prints or other
matter which it is desirable to bring particularly to public notice.
Stands on the model of the standard newspaper slope illustrated
in <a href="#Fig166">Fig. 166</a>, but lighter, and made in parts or collapsible, with
a projecting bottom edge to support books or prints, and a wire
stretched near the top to keep them in position, have been used;
and the walls can have run along them a narrow moulding
grooved to take the prints, with a taut wire, which can be made
adjustable to any height, above them as on the slopes. With
such an arrangement a modest but effective exhibition can be
made in a very short time. It is thought by some that an open
access library is itself a book exhibition, but even with this
system, and certainly with the indicator system, there are many
things that can be exhibited with advantage. Such works as
Williams&#8217;s <i>History of the Art of Writing</i>, the facsimiles published
by the British Museum, and other large treasure houses; photographic
surveys; connected series of rare or interesting books;
books on subjects of immediate interest, and so on, can all be
exhibited to good result. Simple but careful guiding is desirable,
and every method of connecting the exhibition with the reading
facilities of the library must be brought into play. Usually
the exhibitions can be arranged from material in the library&#8217;s
stock, but they may often be borrowed from national institutions,
other libraries, and private collectors. Whenever material
is borrowed an insurance policy should be arranged covering
loss or damage.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec538">538.</h4>

<p><b>538.</b> The warning is perhaps not unnecessary that the library
is neither museum nor art gallery; and exhibitions which
trespass upon the field of these institutions should only be
arranged in towns where they do not exist; and even then a
certain restraint should be observed; but circumstances will
determine this question. If the exhibition leads to the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_476" id="Page_476">[476]</a></span>
books, it is justified; if not, the library is doing work which is
not properly in its province.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec539">539. Reading Circles, etc.</h4>

<p><b>539. Reading Circles, etc.</b>&mdash;Reading circles in connexion with
the National Home Reading Union and similar bodies, or arranged
locally, present special opportunities for libraries, and are to be
encouraged. Good leaders can be obtained in most towns;
books on the subjects discussed can be made available in the
room where the circle meets, and in various ways the library can
help effectively. One or two libraries have literary societies of
the debating kind; but these are more difficult to arrange.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec540">540. General.</h4>

<p><b>540. General.</b>&mdash;The statement made in the last edition that
all the work described in this chapter is secondary to the main
purpose of the library is repeated. Its value has been proved
and is indisputable, but it is easy for the enthusiastic librarian
to involve himself and the library in more of these activities
than his own time, his staff, or his means justify. Only local
circumstances and common sense can fix the limits beyond
which they ought not to be carried. Voluntary assistance, if it
is forthcoming of sufficient and satisfactory quality, should be
encouraged; but even here discretion is required. Moreover,
certain good standards for lectures, readings, etc., should be
fixed; bad lectures and readings may do more harm than good,
and only towns with many good readers amongst the people
should attempt work so full of chance as dramatic readings.
Excellent and much to be desired in their right measure and
kind, all extension activities should be pursued with considered
moderation.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXV<br />
<span class="title">RURAL LIBRARIES</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec542">542. The Need, and Earlier Schemes.</h4>

<p><b>542. The Need, and Earlier Schemes.</b>&mdash;Until recently a rural
dweller in Canada, the United States, and some parts of Australia
was better provided with literature than the villager in the United
Kingdom. It is true that private generosity had established
village libraries and circulating collections of books in several
counties; and honourable mention may be made of the schemes
of the Union of Lancashire and Cheshire Institutes, 1847; the
Yorkshire Union of Educational Institutes, 1854; the Central
Circulating Library, 1888; the Bishop of Hereford, 1906; the
Dorset Book-Lending Association, 1908; and the extensive
scheme for the Highlands and Hebrides of Mr James Coats of
Paisley; as also Sir Charles Seeley&#8217;s scheme for the Isle of
Wight, and the Westmorland scheme, which are both, however,
public ventures worked through the County Council in the first
case, and, in the second, through the Kendal Public Library. All
of these (except the Coats scheme) work on the sound method
of dispatching to selected (and, in some of the private instances,
subscribing) centres boxes of books which are changed twice or
thrice yearly.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec543">543.</h4>

<p><b>543.</b> The private schemes, effective as they are, are unable to
supply that co-ordinated service which may be expected from a
state, or rate, maintained service; and as a whole the rural
population is unprovided as yet. Although the need for general
library provision has been abundantly recognized, the imagination
of British legislators seems to have been unable to compass
anything practical towards meeting it. The reasons for lack of
village libraries turn upon the small product of the penny rate,
which in an average population of 400&mdash;a frequent population
figure for a village&mdash;rarely exceeds &pound;10 yearly, a sum manifestly
inadequate to provide or maintain a library. Ignorance of even
this possibility and the traditional apathy or actual hostility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_478" id="Page_478">[478]</a></span>
squire and parson, at least until lately, to any scheme of rural
enlightenment may also have been factors; but, however that
may be, in 1915 only seventy-six out of all the parishes of the
kingdom had libraries working under the Acts. Co-operation
alone can produce for these scattered populations the benefits
of a sound service; but although the Libraries Acts (1892,
Sections 9-10; 1893, Section 4) permit the co-operation of
neighbouring urban districts or parishes for the provision of
libraries, the method has been resorted to only occasionally, as
at Workington and Harrington in Cumberland, where some such
combination exists.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec544">544. The County Council as Library Authority.</h4>

<p><b>544. The County Council as Library Authority.</b>&mdash;The obvious
authority to establish and administer rural libraries is the County
Council; but there is no explicit legislative instruction, or even
permission, for them to do so. The Carnegie United Kingdom
Trust has given careful and sympathetic attention to this problem,
and to this body the recent rapid development of rural
libraries is due. Acting on a recommendation of Professor
W. G. S. Adams, in his valuable <i>Report on Library Provision and
Policy</i>, 1915, that experimental library systems should be established
in five selected areas in different parts of the kingdom, the
Trustees invited certain County Councils through their education
committees, and certain towns well placed in regard to surrounding
rural districts, to accept grants for such work. Professor
Adams advised the provision of (1) a central library, from
which the books could be distributed at regular intervals, and
from which also there should be supervision of the whole area;
(2) village libraries, usually placed in a school, with the schoolmaster
as librarian, and consisting of a permanent collection of
important reference and standard works, and a circulating
library which would be exchanged at three-monthly or other
suitable intervals. The first areas chosen were Staffordshire as
a county; Worksop, Nottinghamshire, as a town centred amongst
villages; and the Trustees themselves established at the public
library of their own centre, Dunfermline, a system to deal with
the Orkneys, Shetland and the island of Lewis, and to reinforce
by circulating collections the Coats libraries in other districts.
The scheme has developed rapidly, and at the time of writing
the counties of Dorset, Gloucester, Lincoln, Nottingham,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_479" id="Page_479">[479]</a></span>
Somerset, Stafford, Warwick, Westmorland, Wilts, York,
Montgomery, Brecon, Buckingham, Cardigan, Carnarvon, Forfar,
Lewis, Orkney and Shetland, Perth, Kerry and Limerick are
all administering, or have accepted, grants for rural libraries.
The grants range in amount from about &pound;3000 to &pound;7000 each,
and are initial and experimental; that is to say, the sum provided
is intended to establish and maintain the library system
for a space of five years, after which it is expected that they
will be administered entirely from county funds.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec545">545. The Methods of Carnegie Rural Libraries.</h4>

<p><b>545. The Methods of Carnegie Rural Libraries.</b>&mdash;It is too early
yet to assess the results of these schemes or to expatiate with
any certainty upon their methods; but an account of the administration
of the Trust&#8217;s own scheme for the North of Scotland may
be taken as typical, because, with the necessary variations imposed,
or considered desirable, in the various county schemes,
it is the standard for them all.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec546">546. The Central Repository.</h4>

<p><b>546. The Central Repository.</b>&mdash;At the central repository the
books are collected, classified, catalogued, dispatched and
received; and accommodation sufficient for these purposes is
provided. The extent of the initial stock, which is intended
later to be fully representative of English and translated foreign
literature, literature in Gaelic, local industries, science, history
and topography, is such as to provide a collection of about
seventy-five books for each centre to be served; and the
travelling collections consist in equal proportions of general
works, fiction for adult readers, and literature for children.
Later, however, the selection will be influenced largely by the
demands made by the local librarians. In the first case collections
were exchanged twice yearly. Certain current periodicals,
not returnable, were also sent out in boxes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Accession.</span>&mdash;A slip suggestions record is used, one slip being
written for each title; and from this the order list is compiled.
Both order and slips are stamped with the date of the order, and
when the books are received and found to be correct the slips
are stamped with the date of receipt. The slips are then filed
to form a continuous catalogue of accessions. Accessioning is
done the ordinary way; all books are stamped throughout with
a rubber-stamp impression of the name of the Trust; and the
board label reads thus:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_480" id="Page_480">[480]</a></span></p>

<div class="rural" id="Fig181">

<p class="center highline2">RURAL LIBRARIES.</p>

<p>Readers are requested to take
great care of the books while in their
possession, and to point out any
defect they may notice in them to the
librarian.</p>

<p>All books should be returned to
the Library within 14 days from
date of issue; but an extension of the
period of loan will be granted when
desired.</p>

</div><!--rural-->

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Fig. 181.</span>&mdash;Rural Library Board Label<br />(<a href="#Sec546">Section 546</a>).</p>

<p class="blankbefore"><span class="smcap">Classification.</span>&mdash;The Decimal classification is used, to two
places for general works, and to four places for works on
specific subjects; this enables a fairly minute arrangement.
The common adjustments are made of removing Fiction and
Biography from 900, and arranging the former in alphabetical-author
order, and the latter alphabetically by persons
biographed.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cataloguing.</span>&mdash;A simple form of classified catalogue, with
author and subject indexes, is used; and the date of publication
is omitted from the bibliographical particulars, as the latest
editions are always to be presumed. Complete catalogues in
this form are eventually to be sent to all centres, but meanwhile
separate typed lists, covering each collection, are sent out
with the collection.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Central Charging.</span>&mdash;The method of charging books to the
various centres is simple. A card index in the usual form is
drawn upon, the cards for each consignment of books being
abstracted and placed behind a guide bearing the name of the
centre. A date guide is inserted when the dispatch is made, and
the &#8220;deliveries index&#8221; thus made forms a convenient guide to
the books at any given centre, and, of course, is a means by
which returned books are checked.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dispatches.</span>&mdash;Books are dispatched in boxes, specially constructed
in deal, 18 &times; 12 &times; 12 inches inside measurements, which
hold about forty-five volumes. They are banded with hoop
iron, which is secured by screw-in iron bolts, and iron bars,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_481" id="Page_481">[481]</a></span>
screwing with nuts to the bolts, secure the lid. The interior is
lined with waterproof paper; and flush handles are fitted to
each box. The design is intended to meet the very rough usage
probable in transit to remote districts. In ordinary rural service
a much lighter box, of three-ply wood, has been found to
be quite suitable. It is probably better, too, to have smaller
boxes, as the handling of heavy boxes of books is a difficulty for
both carrier and librarian.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec547">547. The Village Centres.</h4>

<p><b>547. The Village Centres.</b>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Local Administration.</span>&mdash;The
local administration of the libraries is in the hands of central
committees formed of members of secondary education and
library committees, and other interested people, with the
librarians of the towns in the area as secretaries. These committees
cover each a number of parishes, and for the immediate
supervision of the parishes local sub-committees of members of
school boards, teachers, etc., have been formed, and of these the
schoolmaster is generally the secretary and local custodian of
the books. These committees advise on book requirements and
on such matters as shelving, etc.; central committees are also
expected to raise the small funds for the conveyance of the books.
The average library finds accommodation in the schools, and
permanent collections, which include the more expensive and
general reference books, are deposited in village institutes and
existing Carnegie public libraries. Schools requiring shelves are
supplied with deal cases, having five adjustable shelves, and a
book-capacity of 150 volumes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Charging.</span>&mdash;The record of stock in use at the centres is on
cards which are sent out in their card-case from the central
repository. These card-cases are of cloth over strawboard, hold
approximately 150 cards, are 8 &times; 5<sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub> inches in size, and are made
in the shape of an ordinary square-backed book-cover, with
eyelet holes below the hinge through which cords are laced on
which the cards are secured. Inside these cases the cards for
each consignment of books are arranged in classified order.
The card used is as shown on <a href="#Page_482">page 482</a> (<a href="#Fig182">Figs. 182</a> and <a href="#Fig183">183</a>).</p>

<p>When books are received at the local centre the librarian checks
them with the cards and arranges them in the order of the cards
on the shelves. The charging method is obvious. The charge
is made under the name of the author, particulars of readers
and date of issue and return being entered in the appropriate
columns, the word &#8220;adult&#8221; being written in the age column
for readers obviously over twenty-one. The charges are returned
to the repository at the exchange periods, and these enable
statistics to be made.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec548">548. Museum of Rural Library Appliances.</h4>

<p class="blankbefore"><b>548. Museum of Rural Library Appliances.</b>&mdash;The above are,
in brief, the chief features of the North of Scotland scheme,
which seems to be serving its purpose admirably; and in connexion
with it the Trust is building up at Dunfermline a small
museum of rural library appliances, to include different types of
boxes, forms, and other machinery tried in the various centres.
This valuable work will in time furnish librarians with a considerable
amount of important and useful data.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec549">549. Other Schemes</h4>

<p><b>549. Other Schemes</b>.&mdash;As the North of Scotland scheme is
continuing in the control of the Carnegie Trust, it is on a rather
different footing from the county schemes, which are in the
control of the county education committee. In general, however,
the methods are the same. There is a central repository
where books are selected, catalogued, dispatched, and overhauled
on return, and where reading courses, special catalogues,
etc., may be prepared; indeed, whence skilled advice and assistance
may be drawn by all the village centres. And, as recommended
by Professor Adams, local village schools are the deposit
centres, with schoolmasters as a rule for librarians. The smaller
towns have in some places made arrangements by which they
amalgamate or co-operate with county schemes, but the larger
towns usually work independently.</p>

<p>A rough estimate of the cost of an actual rural library scheme
founded on a Carnegie grant may be given:</p>

<p>Thus the annual cost of the scheme after the initial expenses
have been met is reckoned at &pound;590, but the salary allowed here
is inadequate. It is at this point that the legal powers of the
County Councils may be tested. It is difficult to imagine the
Local Government Board auditor ruling that they cannot provide
such library maintenance out of education funds because the
Education Act of 1918 does not mention it (although the Scottish
Act of 1918 does, and permits it), but the matter has not been
questioned yet.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec550">550. General Considerations.</h4>

<p><b>550. General Considerations.</b>&mdash;Every librarian will see the
potentialities of this work, as completing in a large measure the
public library system of the country; moreover, its rapid and
successful development is an earnest of the immense future of
libraries as a whole. By co-ordinating this village work with
such educational agencies as University Extension, and the
Workers&#8217; Educational Association, it will be possible to give to
rural life many of the intellectual advantages hitherto exclusively
the possession, for the non-wealthy classes, of town life, and
this at a time when settlement on the land is proceeding apace.
Meanwhile the supervising rural librarian may make regular
visits throughout his area, in which he will give advice on reading,
demonstrations in the use and care of books, and exercise
the undoubted opportunities he will have of bringing people of
like intellectual pursuits, but in different villages, into touch
with one another. All this presupposes the existence of a
professional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_485" id="Page_485">[485]</a></span>
librarian in control of the entire scheme. An initial
mistake has been made in some counties in appointing teachers
to this position, on the theory, no doubt, that the training of
teachers is a very suitable basis for work with libraries which
are locally administered by teachers. It may be so&mdash;the evidence
is not yet forthcoming&mdash;but we do not think so. Library
organization, especially at the outset, demands the specialist,
and the librarian differs radically in training and mental attitude
from the teacher. Further, the salaries hitherto offered have
ranged from &pound;150 to &pound;300 per annum&mdash;have in only one case
reached the higher figure&mdash;and these sums must be augmented
considerably if the rural libraries are to attract and retain the
librarians they really need.</p>

MUSEUMS AND ART GALLERIES</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER XXXVI<br />
<span class="title">MUSEUMS AND ART GALLERIES</span></h3>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec552">552.</h4>

<p><b>552.</b> There are museums of all kinds in existence, some of
them of world-wide importance, and they may be roughly
classified into the following groups:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">General Museums.</span>&mdash;These are collections of a miscellaneous
kind, comprising art, science, arch&aelig;ological and other objects,
and aiming more or less at universality. The British Museum
was at one time a universal collection, but since it was divided
into art, ethnological, natural history and industrial departments,
it no longer forms a general collection under one roof.
Soane&#8217;s Museum in Lincoln&#8217;s Inn Fields, London, is a general
museum, and there are many others in the provinces.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">National Museums.</span>&mdash;Collections illustrative of the arts,
manufactures, antiquities, literature and history of a nation.
These range in extent from the great German, Hungarian and
French museums, down to museums of national antiquities,
like those of the Societies of Antiquaries of England, Scotland
and Ireland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Science Museums.</span>&mdash;Comprising Anatomical, Botanical, Geological,
Chemical, Physical, General Natural History, Astronomical,
Ethnological and other varieties. Typical examples
are the Hunterian Museum of Anatomy at the Royal College
of Surgeons, London; the Herbarium at Kew; the Museum of
Practical Geology; the Pharmaceutical Society; the Natural
History Museum at South Kensington; the United Service
Museum (Naval and Military) at Whitehall; and the historical
collections of the British Museum which include Ethnology.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Local Museums.</span>&mdash;These are to be found in all parts of the
country, and they usually serve to illustrate and preserve the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_487" id="Page_487">[487]</a></span>
natural history and antiquities of a particular district; and they
differ from national museums, in being restricted to a particular
locality.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Special Museums.</span>&mdash;Of these there is practically no end.
They have been formed to illustrate certain restricted departments
of science, art or history, such as Hygiene, Numismatics,
Watch-making, Heraldry, Costume, etc., and they resemble
exhibitions of a special kind, save that they are permanent.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec553">553.</h4>

<p><b>553.</b> Generally speaking, a museum is a collection of the
objects which go towards the formation of a subject, just as a
library is a collection of the literature connected with a subject
or subjects. The museum is necessary to the material conception
of a subject, just as literature is essential as the permanent
record of the subject. For example, in tracing the evolution of
the printed book from its manuscript forms, one can form an
idea of the appearance of such books by reading up the relative
literature, and examining a few facsimiles, and so on; but, in
order to realize in a perfect way the aspect, atmosphere and
details of early writing and printing, one must go to the great
exhibitions or museums of such books at the British Museum
or John Rylands Library, Manchester. It is the same with
machinery. While a diagram of a machine as it appears in a
book may be comprehensible to a few specially educated minds,
it would be a mere puzzle to an ordinary human being unless
he could go to a museum like that at South Kensington and
see a working model of the machine in operation. He could
then realize in a practical and concrete way the merely graphic
or theoretical view afforded by the book.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec554">554.</h4>

<p><b>554.</b> All the great State museums in the country have been
established under the provisions of special Acts of Parliament.
Some of these, like the various acts establishing the British
Museum, date from the eighteenth century, while others are
much more recent. It is not proposed to deal with the legislation
and history of the State museums, nor is it necessary to do
more than describe, later on, their relations with the municipal
museums which may now be considered.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec555">555.</h4>

<p><b>555.</b> In 1845 was passed the first Museums Act (8 &amp; 9 Vict.,
c. 43) &#8220;for encouraging the establishment of museums in large
towns,&#8221; under which the local authorities of towns over 10,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_488" id="Page_488">[488]</a></span>
of population were permitted to erect museums and levy a halfpenny
rate. No specimens could be bought, but an entrance
fee of 1d. could be charged. This Act was practically inoperative,
as only Canterbury, Warrington, Leicester, Dover, Salford
and a few other places adopted it, and in 1850 it was incorporated
in the first Public Libraries Act, 1850 (13 &amp; 14 Vict., c. 65),
which repealed it and added the permissive clauses which existed
till 1893. This Act in its turn was repealed by that of 1855, and
again this was repealed by the Public Library Act of 1892 and
subsequent amendments, which remain the leading Acts under
which libraries may be established, with such subsidiary departments
as museums and art galleries. A digest of the powers
conferred on local authorities by those various Acts appears in
<a href="#Sec4">Section 4</a> of this <i>Manual</i>. The authorities seem to have become
aware of the difficulty of supporting so many institutions out
of one restricted rate, because in 1891 was passed &#8220;An Act to
enable Urban Authorities to provide and maintain Museums and
Gymnasiums.&#8221; Under this Act, which did not apply to Scotland
or the County of London, but only to England and Ireland,
local authorities were enabled to levy a special rate of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>d. per
pound for museum purposes, and a rate of <sup>1</sup>&#8260;<sub>2</sub>d. per pound
for gymnasium purposes, and to make regulations for the
purposes of both kinds of institutions. In 1901 this Act was
extended to the County of London by the &#8220;Public Libraries
Act, 1901.&#8221; A resolution of the local authority is sufficient for
the purpose of adopting this Act, and the regulations for adoption
are similar to those prescribed for the Public Libraries
Acts. The principal clauses of the Act are as follows:</p>

<p><i>Clause 4.</i>&mdash;&#8220;An urban authority may provide and maintain
museums for the reception of local antiquities or other objects
of interest, and gymnasiums with all the apparatus ordinarily
used therewith, and may erect any buildings, and generally do
all things necessary for the provision and maintenance of such
museums and gymnasiums.&#8221;</p>

<p><i>Clause 5.</i>&mdash;&#8220;A museum provided under this Act shall be
open to the public not less than three days in every week free
of charge, but subject thereto an urban authority may admit
any person or class of persons thereto as they think fit, and
may charge fees for such admission, or may grant the use of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_489" id="Page_489">[489]</a></span>
the same or of any room therein, either gratuitously or for
payment, to any person for any lecture or exhibition or for any
purpose of education or instruction.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#8221;</p>

<p>Full power is given by other clauses to make all necessary
regulations as to hours, staff, order, etc., in both museums and
gymnasiums, and for borrowing money for buildings or other
purposes.</p>

<p>Separate accounts are to be kept, and &#8220;The amount expended
by an urban authority under this Act shall not in any year
exceed the amount produced by a rate of a halfpenny in the
pound for a museum, and the like amount for a gymnasium
established under this Act.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec556">556.</h4>

<p><b>556.</b> A new provision in legislation of this kind is contained
in Clause 12, which empowers an urban authority to <i>sell</i> a
museum or gymnasium after seven years&#8217; trial, if it is deemed
unnecessary or too expensive, but only with the consent of the
Local Government Board. Any moneys received from such
sale are to be applied, in the first instance, to the repayment of
loans, and if not all required for such a purpose, may, with the
approval of the Local Government Board, &#8220;be applied to any
purpose to which capital moneys are properly applicable.&#8221;</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec557">557.</h4>

<p><b>557.</b> It is further provided (Clause 13) that the powers given
to urban authorities under the Act &#8220;shall be deemed to be in
addition to and not in derogation of any other powers conferred
by Act of Parliament, law, or custom, and such other powers
may be exercised in the same manner as if this Act had not been
passed.&#8221; In other words, the powers conferred by the &#8220;Public
Libraries Acts,&#8221; for example, with regard to museums, still hold
good, and the new powers created by the &#8220;Museums and Gymnasiums
Act&#8221; can be exercised as an addition to them. It
should be noted that, in addition to the general legislation
contained in the Public Libraries and Museums Acts, many
private or local Acts have been passed, under which different
localities have obtained power to spend money on the provision
of museums and art galleries, greatly in excess of the limits
imposed by the general Acts.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec558">558.</h4>

<p><b>558.</b> This represents practically the whole of the legislation
connected with municipal museums, and it may be inferred, from
the financial provision allowed by Parliament, that no museum<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_490" id="Page_490">[490]</a></span>
which depends entirely upon the halfpenny rate can be in a very
flourishing condition. The deficiencies of the rate-income are in
many cases made up by the donations and bequests of private
donors; occasionally public bodies render valuable aid; not
infrequently the closely restricted library rate is nibbled at and
diverted from its real purpose; and very often the State, represented
by the Victoria and Albert Museums at South Kensington,
circulates useful and valuable loan collections. In these
various ways museums are helped, and within the past few years,
or since the Museums Association was established in 1890, the
organization, scientific value and equipment of museums have
improved in a very marked degree. No doubt in some localities
can still be seen the old-fashioned hotch-potch collection of
miscellaneous lumber styled a museum, wherein a stuffed walrus
jostles a suit of armour, and local fossils and meteorites are
beautifully mixed up with birds&#8217; eggs, flint implements and coins.
Such collections only require an alligator, and a canoe from Fiji
on the walls, to be perfect specimens of the Wardour Street kind
of museum. Happily this kind of omnium-gatherum museum
is rapidly dying out before the advance of rational classification,
and in some cases where collections are small and contained in
one room, yet by means of intelligent arrangement incongruous
objects are kept apart, and the little museum is made an instructive
nucleus, instead of a high-class marine-store.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec559">559.</h4>

<p><b>559.</b> This leads to such questions as the elements of museum
classification and description, which are the most important
points in the relations between libraries and schools and museums.
Without classification a general or even special museum is comparatively
useless. Without effective arrangement and descriptive
labelling the specimens remain uninstructive and misleading.
On these two points museums resemble libraries, and it is only
when they agree in the essentials of classification and description
that the institutions become mutually beneficial. A well-classified
and arranged cabinet of minerals, with a full set of
descriptive labels, is simply invaluable to the student of
mineralogy and geology. When, therefore, a student is referred
from the literature to the objects described in the text-books,
he is educated to the extent of being able to appreciate the fact
that objects are grouped together in respect of certain
resemblances,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_491" id="Page_491">[491]</a></span>
and that classification into related groups is the basis
of the science he is studying. On going to a museum of specimens,
such a student, if he were an entomologist, would naturally
expect to find together all the butterflies, bees, beetles, flies
and other objects properly classified according to order, genera
and species. If he found all the moths, bugs, flies and beetles
mingled in one huge jumble, and labelled Insects, the collection
would be uninstructive and would throw no light on his previous
reading.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec560">560.</h4>

<p><b>560.</b> Whatever set of concrete objects a student sets out to
examine in a museum, after being referred from his books, he
expects to find some relationship between the literature he has
studied and the objects he means to compare and examine.
On this principle all the large museums of the world are arranged,
and the result is that no student who has previously acquired
an elementary knowledge of an art or science from text-books
should experience any difficulty in finding his way about a
museum. It is true that, for purposes of popular display and
to tickle up juvenile interest in natural history, some museums
exhibit fine specimens of birds or mammals out of their order,
where they will attract notice, but the bulk of the collection
will be found in strictly classified order. In many important
museums it has been found useful to illustrate animal structure
and comparative anatomy by means of key or type collections,
which are kept apart from the genera classification, yet serve
to illustrate important points in comparative zoology, which it
would be difficult to do on a very extensive scale. There are
many text-books written exactly on the same principle. One
author takes a rabbit, another a crayfish, and from these bases
teach the main facts of animal structure which apply all round.
So in a museum. While it would be absolutely impossible to
repeat at every centre such a fine collection of minerals as has
been gathered together at the Natural History Museum at South
Kensington, yet it is possible to illustrate the main facts and
classification of mineralogy by means of a selection of actual
specimens or models. Similarly at the British Museum, the
student of early printing does not find himself confronted with
a complete chronological sequence of all the books printed in
the fifteenth century to illustrate the incunabula, but he finds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_492" id="Page_492">[492]</a></span>
a selection, or type collection, which in the most effectual way
traces the development and evolution of the printed book. The
more these type collections are adopted and utilized, the greater
will become the value of museums for elementary science teaching,
and as most museums are unable to collect and display
specimens of <i>everything</i> in the world, it is obvious that they
must do as libraries have to do&mdash;select only what is best, most
typical and instructive, and leave indiscriminate collecting to
the great universal museums supported by the State.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec561">561.</h4>

<p><b>561.</b> A well-arranged and classified museum, whether of a
general character, or which is confined to local botany, zoology,
geology and arch&aelig;ology, has great bearing on the educational
work of public libraries. It enables a reader to <i>realize</i> the
material side of his studies, and by showing him related objects
in a definite order, broadens his outlook on the subject, and
brings home to him the reality of the matter. As object-lessons
are to school-children, so are museums to library readers.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec562">562.</h4>

<p><b>562.</b> Art galleries are divisible into three classes&mdash;1. Those
maintained or assisted by the State=the National Gallery;
Scottish National Art Gallery, etc. 2. Those endowed by
private munificence or by public bodies=the Wallace Collection;
Tate Gallery; the Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool, the Harris
Art Gallery, Preston, etc. 3. Those maintained from local
rates levied under special Acts of Parliament; or, under the
Public Libraries Acts, which empower local authorities to support
art galleries out of the penny rate. There is no special
Act for the establishment of art galleries similar to the Museums
Act already described, and apart from special Acts, the Public
Libraries Acts are the only ones which empower the establishment
of art galleries. Needless to say, such powers are rarely
exercised unless other sources of endowment or income are
forthcoming. So many single pictures cost more than the
produce of a penny rate in most towns, that it is, on the face of
it, absurd to think of art galleries only as departments of public
libraries. In some cases part of the library rate is no doubt
used to defray part of the expenses of art galleries, particularly
buildings, but it is very unusual to purchase pictures from such
a meagre fund. Art galleries are greatly assisted by loan exhibitions
contributed to by artists, picture owners, both public<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_493" id="Page_493">[493]</a></span>
and private, and the national art authorities acting through the
Victoria and Albert Museum at South Kensington. Annually
the South Kensington authorities lend to over 400 museums,
exhibitions, schools of art and science, etc., no fewer than 47,000
objects, of which 46,000 are works of art, including pictures,
embroideries, photographs, metal-work, pottery, etc. But for
these circulating collections, comparatively few of the smaller
art galleries of the country could keep alive interest simply by
means of their own permanent collections. It is only in large
towns, like London, Edinburgh, Dublin, Glasgow, Birmingham,
Liverpool, etc., where great and representative collections are
kept illustrating the leading schools of art, that any direct educational
value can be said to attach to art galleries. So far as
educational value is concerned, an art gallery cannot for a
moment be compared to a museum or a library. Its appeal on
the educational side is to a very small section of the public, and
even to this section such appeal is limited by the size and character
of the collection. The student of early Italian or Flemish
painting can learn nothing in a little provincial art gallery,
containing fifty or sixty modern landscapes and figure subjects;
and the student of Impressionist painting will not find much to
help him in a gallery composed of examples of old Dutch and
French masters. The value of an art gallery depends, therefore,
on its size and representative nature so far as art students
are concerned, and on the appeal which fine paintings make to
the higher feelings and perceptions of mankind for its influence
as a creator of taste and stimulator of a love of the beautiful.
When an art collection takes the form of a special exhibition
illustrative of a subject, rather than a particular school of painting,
its value and interest are enormously increased. Suppose,
for example, that an art gallery is devoted to an exhibition
illustrative of some great historical subject, like the career of
Napoleon I. The value of the pictorial side of the subject at
once stands forth with great prominence, and one can realize
the educational value of art in the exposition of history. But
in a mere random collection of pictures, on all kinds of subjects,
by all kinds of painters, there is no kind of consecutive teaching
or definite connexion with the art literature contained in a
library, and, therefore, such a miscellaneous selection of pictures<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_494" id="Page_494">[494]</a></span>
is chiefly valuable as a kind of vague appeal to the &aelig;sthetic
feelings of the casual observer. Only great collections like those
of the National Gallery in London, and the Louvre at Paris, can
be said to illustrate the literature of art, and it is chiefly in regard
to such art galleries that some direct connexion can be traced
between art collections and libraries.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec564">564.</h4>

<p><b>564.</b> It will be difficult but it is desirable to attempt to resolve
some order out of the terminological chaos at present existing.</p>

<p>The British Government has many library positions in its control,
but the term librarian is only sparingly recognized. There are
&#8220;librarians&#8221; of the two Houses of Parliament, the British Museum,
the Board of Education, Admiralty, Patent Office and other Government
departments, but only in the Houses of Parliament are there
any assistant-librarians so-named. The heads of departments in
the British Museum are called &#8220;keepers,&#8221; a traditional term, and
the assistant librarians &#8220;Assistants in the Department of Printed
Books&#8221; or &#8220;Manuscripts,&#8221; as the case may be, which as a term in
no way connects them with librarianship. In the Patent Office the
term &#8220;Custodian&#8221; was formerly employed, but was dropped some
eight years ago for &#8220;Assistant in the Library.&#8221; In the other Government
or Civil Service libraries the assistant librarian is usually rated
and named as a first- or second-class clerk, as the case may be. It
would be greatly to the advantage of librarianship if a proper
Government recognition of the term librarian as representing a
specially trained type of man rather than the occupant of a certain
position could be obtained. At present it seems that clerks in any
Government office possessing a library can be moved from the office
proper to the library, and <i>vice versa</i>.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec565">565.</h4>

<p><b>565.</b> In municipal and similar public libraries the chaos is even
more pronounced. The principal officer calls himself Chief, Principal,
Head, Borough or City Librarian, or merely Librarian. Often
the term Chief Librarian is adopted where the owner of the name is
the only librarian on the staff, and the term &#8220;Chief&#8221; in these
circumstances is meaningless.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec567">567.</h4>

<p><b>567.</b> In the nomenclature of assistant librarians the confusion is
worse still. The principal assistant to the librarian is called the
Deputy, Chief Assistant, Assistant- or Sub-Librarian in large libraries;
but the terminology is imitated by the smaller libraries, and it is
no uncommon matter to hear of an assistant with a salary of &pound;30
per annum called a &#8220;sub-librarian,&#8221; and &#8220;chief assistant&#8221; and
similar terms are used very loosely to the bewilderment of library
authorities, who find that the Deputy Librarian of a great library<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_496" id="Page_496">[496]</a></span>
like Birmingham holds apparently the same position as the untrained
lad in a village library.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec568">568.</h4>

<p><b>568.</b> It is undoubtedly desirable to formulate a series of definitions
which should govern the application of names to library
positions. The resulting nomenclature if generally adopted would
prevent the anomalies referred to. No librarian should call himself
a chief librarian unless he directs the work of librarians; the adjective
is distinctly a relative term. Similarly a deputy- or a sub-librarian
should be clearly a librarian of some technical equipment
and training though he does not happen to hold an independent
position. To apply this name to a young or boy assistant is undignified
and is bound to cause confusion.</p>

<h4 class="hidden" id="Sec569">569.</h4>

<p><b>569.</b> The following definitions are therefore tentatively recommended
for general adoption as solving the difficulties under consideration.
At the same time, human nature being what it is, we
shall probably never do away altogether with a meaningless and
inflated use of official terms in small libraries, and anything like a
general adoption of our proposed definitions in the larger libraries
is perhaps unlikely. Even so, the adoption of these or other definitions
for all general statistical purposes would be of great advantage.</p>

<h5><span class="smcap">Suggested Nomenclature and Definitions of
Library Positions</span></h5>

<p><i>Chief Librarian.</i>&mdash;The head librarian of a number of libraries, or
a library system, under the charge of &#8220;librarians.&#8221; In the case of a
single large library (<i>e.g.</i> the British Museum), where the departmental
chiefs may fitly be styled librarians, the term Chief Librarian may be
used to designate the head; with such exception the term should
never be employed for the head of a single library.</p>

<p><i>Deputy Librarian.</i>&mdash;The principal assistant to a Chief Librarian,
whose work belongs strictly to the general administration of a
system. Not to be confused with Sub-Librarian.</p>

<p><i>Librarian.</i>&mdash;The head of a library. Not to be confused with Chief
Librarian, the head of a system of libraries.</p>

<p><i>Sub-Librarian.</i>&mdash;The principal assistant to a librarian, whose work
is independent of departments, but not independent of a building.
Not to be confused with Deputy Librarian.</p>

<p id="Ref18"><i>Librarian-in-Charge.</i>&mdash;The officer in charge of a district or branch
library, or one of the departments of a central library, in a system
under the control of a Chief Librarian. Not to be confused with
Librarian.</p>

<p><i>Branch Librarian.</i>&mdash;Term not to be used. See <a href="#Ref18">Librarian-in-Charge</a>.</p>

<p><i>Chief Assistant.</i>&mdash;An officer in charge of a department, subordinate
to a Sub-Librarian. If subordinate to a Deputy Librarian
the corresponding office would be Librarian-in-Charge.</p>

<p><i>Senior Assistant.</i>&mdash;A higher grade of library assistant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_497" id="Page_497">[497]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Junior Assistant.</i>&mdash;A lower grade of library assistant.</p>

<p><i>Attendant.</i>&mdash;A person who carries books, and performs other
mechanical unskilled routine. If a youth, the term &#8220;page&#8221; may
be used.</p>

<p><i>Janitor.</i>&mdash;An officer (generally in uniform) whose principal duty
is to maintain order in the building.</p>

<p><i>Clerk.</i>&mdash;A person employed in general clerking work, not a part of
the professional library staff.</p>

<p><i>Probationer.</i>&mdash;An assistant &#8220;on trial,&#8221; or not permanently appointed,
who may or may not be paid.</p>

THE LIBRARIAN&#8217;S LIBRARY</h2>

<h3 class="hidden" id="Sec570">570.</h3>

<p><b>570.</b> The following is a classified list of the principal books which
a librarian will require as the chief tools of his profession. It does
not claim to be a complete bibliography, many valuable pamphlets
and publications of institutions being omitted owing to limited
space.</p>

<p>The majority of the works mentioned should be available for the
benefit of the staff of the larger libraries, while two suggestive
selections are indicated by asterisks as follows:</p>

<p>** selection for a small library, income less than &pound;1500.</p>

<p><span class="padl1">* selection for a medium library, income less than &pound;3000.</span></p>
